## Our ProtoType Spy is called Lilly after a cat we know

The first Growspy prototype is called Lilly aftethe [NDB's](https://ncpapp.eu) cat. Anyhoo, It's shows the current and historical readings from a [Pimoroni Enviro Grow](/pimoroni). It is on 24/7 (unless it's broken), feeding environment data to the DB which is updated on this app
