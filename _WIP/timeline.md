Here's a timeline of the development of frontend web technologies from 1996 to the present day:

1. 1996: HTML 3.2
   - HTML 3.2 was the first formal specification for HTML and introduced tables, applets, and basic form elements.

2. 1997: CSS Level 1
   - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Level 1 was introduced, allowing developers to separate the presentation and layout from the HTML structure.

3. 1998: ECMAScript 1 (ES1)
   - The first standardized version of JavaScript, known as ECMAScript 1 (ES1), was released by ECMA International.

4. 1999: HTML 4.01 and CSS Level 2
   - HTML 4.01 brought more semantic elements and improved forms, while CSS Level 2 provided more layout options and improvements to CSS.

5. 2004: HTML5 and CSS3
   - HTML5 and CSS3 introduced new structural elements, multimedia support (video and audio), canvas for graphics, and improvements in form controls.

6. 2006: jQuery
   - jQuery, a popular JavaScript library, was released, simplifying DOM manipulation and making it easier to write JavaScript code.

7. 2008: Google Chrome and WebKit/Blink
   - Google Chrome was launched, introducing the WebKit rendering engine, which later evolved into Blink. This marked a significant shift in web browsers.

8. 2010: Responsive Web Design
   - Ethan Marcotte coined the term "Responsive Web Design," promoting the idea of creating websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

9. 2011: CSS Grid Layout
   - CSS Grid Layout was introduced, providing a powerful system for creating complex layouts in CSS.

10. 2015: ECMAScript 6 (ES6) / ECMAScript 2015
    - ES6 brought significant enhancements to JavaScript, including arrow functions, classes, modules, and more, making JavaScript code more modern and maintainable.

11. 2015: React and Angular 2
    - React, developed by Facebook, and Angular 2, the successor to AngularJS, were released, revolutionizing frontend development with component-based architectures.

12. 2016: Vue.js
    - Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, gained popularity for its simplicity and flexibility.

13. 2017: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
    - PWAs emerged as a concept, combining the best of web and native applications, providing better performance, offline capabilities, and an app-like experience.

This timeline covers some of the significant milestones in frontend web development technologies, from the early days of HTML and CSS to the advent of Progressive Web Apps in recent years. Note that the web development landscape is constantly evolving, and new technologies and frameworks continue to emerge beyond the scope of this timeline.
