## [Growspy.app](https://growspy.app)

"As growers we needed the ability to monitor Temperature, Humidity, Light & Soil Moisture over time from a simple device connected by wi-fi to Cloud API so we can view it on our phone"

### How it works

Part 1) Software

> The Web App connects to the API and subscribes to real time updates to Spy data. Every time a Spy tings, it automagically updates

- [ncpapp.eu](https://ncpapp.eu)

Part 2) Hardware

> Monitors Temperature, Humidity, Light & Soil Moisture and sends readings to Growspy API every 5 minutes. Readings are monitored on any mobile phone

> When the Enviro Grow is awake it can also connect to the internet via your household wi-fi and post the readings data it has collected to the API in the cloud. This takes up a lot of power, but it's kinda critical, so we do it every 5 mins aswell
