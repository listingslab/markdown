Flash was popular in the development of web apps primarily during the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s. It gained significant traction and widespread adoption during this period for creating interactive and multimedia-rich web applications. Some key milestones in Flash's popularity include:

1. Late 1990s: Flash was initially introduced by Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe) in 1996. By the late 1990s, it had started to gain attention as a tool for creating simple animations and interactive elements on websites.

2. Early 2000s: As internet speeds increased and broadband became more common, web developers began to embrace Flash to create more complex and engaging web applications. Flash provided a way to create interactive websites with animated menus, games, multimedia content, and other dynamic elements.

3. Mid-2000s: Flash became the de facto standard for creating online multimedia content and interactive experiences. Websites often used Flash to deliver audio and video players, photo galleries, and advertisements.

4. Flash-based Web Games: Flash was widely used for developing web-based games, ranging from casual games to more complex and immersive experiences. Popular gaming websites heavily relied on Flash to deliver a wide variety of games.

5. E-learning and Multimedia Content: Flash found extensive use in e-learning platforms and digital content delivery systems due to its ability to present interactive educational materials.

6. Video Streaming: Before the widespread adoption of HTML5's native video support, Flash was commonly used for video streaming, allowing websites to provide video content to their users.

Flash's popularity in web app development was partly due to its ease of use, rich multimedia capabilities, and relatively broad support across different web browsers and operating systems. It offered a way for developers to create visually appealing and interactive content without relying solely on static HTML and limited JavaScript.

However, as mentioned earlier, Flash started to face several issues, including security vulnerabilities, performance concerns, and lack of mobile support. These factors, along with the rise of HTML5 and open web standards, eventually led to the decline of Flash in modern web app development. Today, Flash is no longer used, and web developers have transitioned to more modern technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create interactive and multimedia-rich web applications.
