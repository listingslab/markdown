Guava Jelly buds are a sweet-smelling treat even before they’re consumed. The plant’s slender-bladed leaves are medium green, and the flower clusters are a lime colour due to the sparkling clear golden trichomes. Calyxes are large and oval shaped. Their long pistils start out more yellow than white, then change to deep pink as the buds ripen. Growth pattern of Guava Jelly by White LabelWhite Label Guava Jelly feminized cannabis seeds are 50% indica, 50% sativa. They grow well in a greenhouse, or outdoors in a Mediterranean climate, as long as they have daily access to direct sunlight. Growing outdoors allows this hybrid to reach its full size, and greatly increases the yield. Guava Jelly is a vigorous strain and can thrive in favourable outdoor conditions. However, it may require support from stakes or a trellis, as its slender branches may be weighed down by buds at the end of the summer. The height of Guava Jelly can be controlled indoors by flowering the plants when they’re small. As this strain generally triples its height in the flowering stage, clones can be put into flower at 20 cm to 30 cm, to achieve a final height that’s under 100 cm. The strain’s tendency to produce branches that grow upwards rather than outwards makes it suitable for the Sea of Green (SOG) training method. The original Guava Jelly seed plants often benefit from a longer vegetation time. Their height and structure can be optimised for indoor grow-spaces by pruning plants to create multiple stems (AKA topping). Supercropping or the Screen of Green (ScrOG) method are also effective.The bud structure of Guava Jelly’s best phenotypes takes the form of fat calyxes, which explode in clusters and grow atop one another in strings. These ropes of calyxes entwine at each node, forming large knots of bud with multiple tips growing in every direction. During flowering they also expand to cover the internodal gaps, filling Guava Jelly’s stem and branches by harvest time. Bud density is greatest at the nodes and bracts, where Guava Jelly’s oversized calyxes almost fight for space. The ropes of calyxes run between the flower clusters, joining them up to form colas that have a quite open structure, without being feathery or underweight. Due to their thick covering of resin glands, even single strands of calyxes become brittle, sticky shards of bud when dried. Smell, taste and effect of Guava Jelly by White LabelGuava Jelly tends to have low growing odour. This variety’s full, fruity bouquet is only released after buds are harvested, dried and broken up. Guava is just one of the fruits in its terpene profile. A deep inhalation will also reveal berry notes from Strawberry Kush, aniseed and citrus from Durban, and a sweet, skunky undercurrent from Wedding Cheesecake.White Label Guava Jelly imparts a powerful high from both its indica and sativa background. Most users report a warm, positive body feeling at first, drawn from its Kush and Skunk ancestry. This effect is enhanced by the uplifting, energetic, electric high of Guava Jelly’s sativa side. Many connoisseurs get so absorbed in the initial happy indica ‘stone’ that they don’t realise how high they are until they try to stand up.
