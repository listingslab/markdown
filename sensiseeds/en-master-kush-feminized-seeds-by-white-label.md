What do you get if you cross two well-known landraces from India and Afghanistan? Master Kush! Growers value the short flowering time and low height. Master Kush Feminized can be enjoyed as weed, kief or in the form of home-made hashish.Master Kush Feminized by White Label growth patternThe Hindu Kush is a legendary region in Asia. Anyone who knows about hemp knows that the world’s best, pure indica genotypes originate from there. The feminized variant of Master Kush by White Label is the result of many years of breeding activities. The result is a super-resinous, compact cannabis strain that produces huge volumes of trichomes. As a favourite among growers who want to produce their own hashish, it has long been established on the scene. The solid buds can be enjoyed in dry form, or immediately smoked or vaped.Typically of an indica, flowering begins relatively early, and lasts for 50 to 55 days. Feminized Master Kush cannabis seeds produce only female plants, which makes weeding out male plants superfluous. This strain is not complicated to grow. It likes to have sufficient nutrients and fertiliser.In a moderate climate, Master Kush Feminized by White Label can be grown outside. It also flourishes magnificently indoors under artificial light. A Sea of Green (SOG) promises the very best results, possibly even in a hydroponic system. But don’t worry even if you’re not familiar with this cultivation technique, and Lollipopping reminds you more of Chupa Chups than cannabis, your plants will still thrive. Master Kush is known for its large yields.Effect, flavour and smell of Master Kush Feminized by White LabelWant to shift back a gear, put up your feet, and really relax for a while? Then Master Kush Feminized by White Label is the perfect choice. The wonderfully relaxing effect is down to its indica genes. Somewhat unusual is the fact that it leaves the mind relatively clear. Sharper sensory awareness means getting the best out of every activity. India fans will immediately recognise the sharp, earthy sandalwood smell: Master Kush is reminiscent of the subcontinent’s well-known, hand-rubbed charas hashish, which is of course logical, since weed from the Kush is one of the main sources for charas production. Did you know?In 2004, Master Kush was awarded the High Life Cannabis Cup.In addition to this feminized strain, you can also order Master Kush by White Label as Master Kush Regular or Master Kush Automatic seeds.
