Early Pearl Regular is a sativa-dominant strain (75% to 25% indica). This means users can expect a classic sativa high; happy, light and cerebral. As such, it’s a great option for using during the day. Early Pearl grows to impressively towering heights and produces formidable harvests. When looked after well, outdoor plants can generate as much as 2 kilos each! Growers can enjoy the distinctive aroma too; fresh notes of sweet citrus and pine, combined with incense and wood. Growth pattern of Early Pearl RegularEarly Pearl Regular cannabis seeds are 75% sativa and 25% indica. It’s the first sativa-dominant strain to be developed specifically to thrive in shorter summers, and in cooler climates. The indica genetics add robustness and ease-of-maintenance (while boosting the yield), but the high is pure sativa; vibrant, uplifting and energising. The seeds are regular, which means that they’ll produce female and male plants. Regular seeds are a good option for those wanting to generate their own seeds for further growing, or who want to experiment with cross-breeding with other strains. It has a relatively short flowering time of 50 to 70 days. To maximise the harvest, growers recommend planting the seeds inside as winter comes to an end, then moving them outside to a sunny spot after spring equinox. When grown outdoors, it’s sensible to anticipate impressive heights. In fact, it’s not uncommon for the plants to reach around 200 to 400 cm! Indoors, the growth is restricted to around 100 to 190 cm. Like many sativa-dominant varieties, Early Pearl Regular is tall and elegant, with extended branches and dark leaves. The buds tend to be densely packed, large, and if the weather is cooler, may take on a purple colour. Towards harvest-time, they’ll also develop a generous coating of white, shining resin. One of the reasons Early Pearl Regular remains popular with growers is its extensive harvests. When cultivated inside, it’s not uncommon to generate about 500 grams per square metre. However, outdoors is where the yields really come into their own. In the right conditions, growers can obtain up to 2 kilograms per plant. It’s a tough, resilient strain, and as a result, does well in cooler climates with shorter summers. However, the plants do require plenty of sunlight in order to reach their full potential. Experienced growers report good success with the lollipopping and supercropping techniques. Effect, taste, and smell of Early Pearl RegularEarly Pearl Regular is 75% sativa and 25% indica, and the high reflects this sativa-dominance perfectly. Users report a fast-acting, energetic effect, which leaves them feeling happy and uplifted. The high is also fairly long-lasting, making the strain an appealing option for daytime use. The plants produce a fresh, zesty scent while growing, with notes of orange and pine. As the buds reach full maturity, the smell grows in strength, and takes on a hint of chopped wood and incense. The citrus and pine can both be detected in the taste. Did you know? It’s a good strain for cross-breeding, and adds stability and strength to future hybrids. Early Pearl Regular was first introduced back in the 1980s, and has been a favourite outdoor variety since then. This is a viable option for beginners, as the plants don’t require too much maintenance or expertise.
