Award-winning seeds that produce tall-growing sativa plants with a high potential yield. The cracking high excites Haze fans with almost psychedelic qualities.Mothers Finest Regular growth patternThis cannabis strain originates from the Jack Herer breeding programme. Unlike Jack, Mothers Finest Regular tends more towards Haze. 70% sativa and 30% indica genes give growers a good idea of what to expect.A sativa hybrid with a flowering time of 50 to 70 days, and elegant, tall-growing plants. The characteristic conical shape of the buds becomes evident early on. They mature into impressive lime-green formations surrounded by the finest resin. Some phenotypes form a mighty main cola.During the flowering stage in particular, these plants gain rapidly in height. Growth can be restricted with a Screen of Green (SCROG), with the plants carefully tied to mesh netting. There’s a nice side effect: these plants generally then increase in yield. Growing outdoors is recommended only in Mediterranean or tropical climates. Given the high Haze proportion, plenty of light and heat are crucial for successful growth.These regular seeds produce female and male plants. Whether you select a particular phenotype or want to breed your own crosses – regular cannabis seeds from Sensi Seeds produce tough and stress-resistant plants.Effect, flavour and smell of Mothers Finest RegularJack Herer is well-known for its powerful high, which takes users straight to stratospheric heights. In this respect, Mothers Finest has nothing in common with its big brother. The lashing, uplifting sativa high leaves no doubt about the high Haze content. Some users may even experience psychedelic effects.The taste and smell are highly dependent on the phenotype. Most smell of pines, with traces of musk, earthy Afghan notes and sweet/sour skunk flavours. The buds have a strong smell even when in flower. Discreet guerrilla growers keen not to draw any attention to themselves should choose a different strain. Jack is a perfect alternative.Did you know?Mothers Finest won awards in two different categories at the Highlife Cup in 2005
