It’s one of the world’s most well-known strains, and not without reason. Northern Lights originated from the US, and has Thai and Afghani landrace parentage.

That means it doesn’t require any special lighting schedule, which makes it easy to cultivate. It’s autoflowering, and the flowering time is relatively speedy – around 60 days in total, with an 11-13-week life cycle. Northern Lights Auto is a compact strain. On average, plants grow to 80 to 130 cm, though they will grow larger when cultivated outside. It’s a suitable option for those that only have limited space, or who want to keep their growing as discreet as possible. Like most indica-dominant varieties, Northern Lights Auto is bushy and squat in appearance, with lots of bushy branches. The buds are dense and coated in sparkling resin, and offer good yields for an auto strain. Growers may generate about 400 grams per square metre when cultivating the plants inside, or around 50-80 grams per plant when growing outdoors. Northern Lights Automatic can be cultivated in cooler climates, though it performs better in warmer conditions, where it’s possible to get two or three harvests each year. Experienced growers claim that planting in May or June is best, with a view to harvesting in August or September. For the best results, growers usually recommend cultivating the plants indoors.
