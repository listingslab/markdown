Black Domina Regular cannabis seeds comprise 95% indica genes. They produce compact, very dark cannabis plants with a central main cola. This is matched by the aroma of black hashish with notes of blackberry. Not two, not three, but four legendary indica strains were involved in the development of Black Domina Regular. The exceptional resin production and narcotic effect originates from the Northern Lights. These properties are further underpinned by the Ortega. Our breeders also added a hash plant to the mix – a strain valued for its short flowering time and bumper harvests. The little-known but all-the-more-valuable Afghani SA guarantees robust growth and high resistance to mould and disease.Black Domina Regular growth patternIf you grow these seeds, you should expect a certain diversity of phenotypes. The indica characteristics always dominate, which is hardly surprising with 95% indica genes. The speed, density and impressive resin production make all Domina feminized varieties potentially suitable and productive mother plants. What’s the first thing you notice when you look at the Black Domina Regular? The dark colour of course, from which the strain takes its name. The black and green leaves are as eye-catching as the dark purple stripes on the buds, which are covered with a shiny layer of trichomes. These cannabis seeds produce compact plants with a solid central cola. After a comparatively short flowering time of around 50 days, Black Domina yields a big harvest. This lady feels most comfortable under artificial light. Outdoor cultivation will succeed only if it stays light and warm for long enough during the summer. Black Domina Regular is otherwise easy to grow and responds generously to advanced cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Supercropping and Lollipopping.Effect, flavour and smell of Black Domina RegularNever underestimate the strength of this Domina strain. Its dulling, some would say narcotic, effect is legendary. It’s definitely not a good choice if you have a busy day, which means that this weed is all the more suitable for a chilled evening on the sofa.In terms of taste, you can look forward to savoury aromas that perfectly match the character of this strain. Pepper and black hashish are mixed with a hint of blackberry, which is reflected in both the flavour and the smell. The bouquet of aromas is rounded off with earthy Afghan tones.Did you know?For novices and growers wanting something even easier, this cannabis strain is also available as Black Domina Feminized.
