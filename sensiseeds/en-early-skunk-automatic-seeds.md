Early Skunk Automatic is 70% indica and 30% sativa. We’ve made sure it’s well-suited to outdoor cultivation, and grows well even in short summers. It’s also mould and pest resistant, making this easy-to-grow strain popular with inexperienced gardeners. Early Skunk Automatic provides a high that’s both relaxing and energising, thanks to its sativa/indica balance. Growth pattern of Early Skunk AutomaticLike all autoflowering varieties, Early Skunk Automatic will happily grow and bloom without needing a change in light cycles. Outdoor gardeners can decide exactly when to begin their grows in order to time the flowering during the warmest months. Expect a total vegetation time of around eight to nine weeks, with the plants developing a new pair of leaves almost every week. After another eight or nine weeks of flowering, the buds will be ready to harvest. A major advantage of all the Early Skunk family is their resistance to bud rot, which (as experienced gardeners will know) can strike in the last few weeks of flowering and devastate a harvest. Early Skunk Automatic is an especially good choice for growers who are concerned about the effects of a damp or humid environment. The short flowering time and Early Pearl genetics make this cannabis seed strain particularly robust. Early Skunk Auto, like the majority of autoflowering strains, is relatively compact. This is even more noticeable when the plants are grown in pots. However, this aspect is part of the strain’s appeal, as it makes the plants ideal for those who need to be discreet. Early Skunk Auto does well in most locations, even balconies and small gardens. At the point of harvesting, expect to see fat, dense buds around the upper nodes and bracts. These usually merge together to form wide, rounded colas. The buds on the lower branches tend to form as individual clumps, and this makes the plant appear quite top-heavy. Please note, due to its autoflowering nature, Early Skunk Auto doesn’t offer quite the same yields as our other versions of this strain. However, this isn’t a problem for most growers, who see it as a fair trade-off for being able to grow cannabis in colder temperatures, without too much effort or expertise. Early Skunk Automatic even offers gardeners the chance to enjoy two harvests in one summer. This is achieved by planting the first in early spring, and the second straight after the first has been harvested. Supercropping and training aren’t suitable for this strain. It does respond well to Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), and lollipopping though. Effect, taste, and smell of Early Skunk AutomaticEarly Skunk Automatic has a potent, heady scent. This is quite mild during the flowering period, but especially noticeable when the buds are being handled. It has warm, spicy undertones (thanks to the sativa component), with a musky, sweet personality. After consumption, users can expect to enjoy a typically ‘skunk’ effect; a relaxing, body-centred high. This is complemented by an uplifting, cerebral sensation, which is due to the sativa genetics. It’s not too over-powering, and this makes it suitable for those looking for a cannabis strain for daytime use, or those who aren’t familiar with the effects of consuming cannabis.
