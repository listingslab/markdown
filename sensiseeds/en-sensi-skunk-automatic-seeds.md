If you want an easy-maintenance, indica-dominant plant that won’t break the bank - you’ve got it. The Sensi Skunk family is based on a cross between a Skunk #1 and a sweet, beautifully scented mother plant that gives it its fresh flavour. Finding growing hard work? It doesn’t need to be!

You can also use a Sea of Green (SOG) to maximise your results. Effect, flavour and smell of Sensi Skunk AutomaticSensi Skunk Automatic is astonishingly potent for an autoflowering cannabis strain.
