Our Big Bud Regular cannabis seeds are celebrated across the world, thanks to the huge yields that the plants produce. The strain is indica-dominant (85%), which means users are guaranteed a blissed-out, relaxing high. One of Big Bud’s most notable features is its enormous, crystal-coated buds, which produce a wonderfully sweet, molasses-like aroma and taste. The comparatively short flowering time is great for those who want quick results. Growth pattern of Big Bud RegularBig Bud Regular cannabis seeds are 85% indica and 15% sativa. As such, the plants have strongly indica-dominant characteristics, both in appearance, and in the high. The strain has an interesting history. Originally, it was bred in the US, from a robust Afghanica and a skunk plant. Thanks to its prolific harvests, it swiftly became a much-loved commercial variety. Big Bud remained popular in the States, until the War on Drugs forced breeders to smuggle it to the Netherlands, where it was further stabilised. Through considerable research, Sensi Seeds took Big Bud right back to its roots, capturing the sturdiness and sweet aroma of the original. Now, its genetics feature Skunk #1 and Northern Lights – two well-established and popular strains. There are feminized or automatic versions of Big Bud available. However, this is a regular variant, which makes it ideal for those that want to produce their own seeds, or experiment with producing different strains. The plants have a comparatively short flowering time of around 50 to 65 days. When grown outdoors, they’re usually harvested around mid- to late October. Big Bud tends to grow to average heights. Inside, plants can be anything from 80 to 160 cm, which is good news for those who live in a smaller home. Outdoors, the plants can reach heights of 180 to 200 cm, which may require a bit more space. This fungus and pest-resistant strain is typically quite narrow in structure, with not as many leaves as other cannabis plants, and enormous buds. Most of these buds grow around the main stem, which makes harvesting easier. The yield is what really appeals to growers, though. Indoors, yields of 500 to 600 g/m² are often reported, and outdoors, this can reach as high as 800 to 1200 grams per plant. Expect plenty of enormous buds with Big Bud Regular. They’re dense and heavy; so heavy in fact, that they sometimes snap the branches they’re growing on if left unsupported. The buds are also covered in thick, shining resin, which gives some indication of the potent high that users can enjoy after harvesting. Big Bud flourishes in warm, sunny climates, such as the Mediterranean. Alternatively, it can be grown indoors, all year round. It responds exceptionally well to supercropping and lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Big Bud RegularBig Bud Regular has strong indica genetics, and this heritage is obvious upon consumption. Users can anticipate a full-body, sedative high, with just a touch of euphoria, thanks to the 15% sativa influence. The strain is prized for its sweet aroma while growing, which some compare to the scent of molasses; sugary, with a hint of spice. Once the buds are harvested, this smell intensifies noticeably. The rich, sweet flavour is also evident in the taste. Did you know? Big Bud Regular is one of Sensi Seed’s biggest yielding strains, with bumper crops that are sure to impress most growers. It’s also available in two other variants; Big Bud Feminized and Big Bud Auto.Big Bud was first developed in the US, in the 1980s. It’s a popular commercial choice, thanks to its prolific harvests. Big Bud is a Cannabis Cup winner (indica cup).
