There’s no doubt: visually, our Michka® is a real feast for the eyes, just like the eponymous activist and author to whom it’s dedicated. The elegant, tall sativa plants have a citrus scent. The potent high, which stimulates creativity, compensates for the comparatively long flowering time. Our breeders wondered for many years which cannabis strain would be worthy of taking the name of Michka Seeliger-Chatelain? During breeding work for Eagle Bill®, the answer suddenly came to us. With its unprecedented elegance and seductive citrus scent, a phenotype from the new line grabbed our full attention. After some experimenting and perfecting, it was finally born: Michka® Regular.Michka® Regular growth patternThis is an indoor strain with 80% sativa genes. Michka® Regular can also be grown outside in a tropical or Mediterranean climate with long summers. Grown outdoors, this strain reaches breathtaking heights. Is resembles a tree in this case.Important note regarding indoor cultivation: Because these plants grow vigorously, the growing room needs to be high enough. If it is not, mesh netting or a Screen of Green (SCROG) may help. Supercropping and Lollipopping also yield good results. Michka® Regular seeds are the perfect choice for maximum harvest in a short time. You definitely need patience and experience. It has a long flowering time: you can reckon on 70 to 85 days. You’ll be rewarded with a harvest of unbelievably beautiful, light-green, thick and compact buds - quite unusual for a sativa. Typical of sativa on the other hand are the spiral-shaped bud formations that ensure sufficient ventilation – which is why this strain shows virtually no mould formation.Effect, flavour and smell of Michka® RegularIf you’re a writer, painter, photographer or musician – Michka® Regular is the perfect strain for artistic activities. It takes quick and long-lasting effect. Its effects are more mental than physical. Typical sativa, then. Be careful, though: at high doses, you may experience some psychedelic effects in addition to the uplifting, cerebral high. There are better strains to choose before heading to bed.What makes this cannabis strain unique are its smell and flavour. During the growing phase, it still has a subtle scent, but as soon as it flowers, it develops more intense citrus tones. The harvested buds smell of grapefruits, lemons and other fruit. To fully savour the flavour notes, get yourself a vaporiser. This is the only way to gently heat the cannabinoids and terpenes - good for the flavour and good for your health. Did you know?We are proud that Michka Seeliger-Chatelain has been a friend of ours for many years. The French grande dame of cannabis, known as the founder of the Mama publishing house, has been campaigning for decades for greater acceptance of our favourite plant. She is also a gifted author. It’s with good reason that four of her books are considered to be standard works. Plus, they’re all bestsellers.If you want an easier life, take a look at Michka® Feminized.
