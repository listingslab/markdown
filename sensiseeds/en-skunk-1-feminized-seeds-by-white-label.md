Skunk #1 feminized seeds by White Label produce highly robust female hybrid plants (65% indica, 35% sativa). Even novices can achieve lush yields.Skunk #1 Feminized by White Label growth patternSkunk #1 Feminized comprises 65% indica and 35% sativa genes. This is the first successfully stabilised cannabis hybrid. Its origins go back to landraces such as Afghani, Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold. Generations of intensive selection and backcrossing were required prior to the birth of Skunk #1. Only the finest examples were considered. The result is evident: for breeders, Skunk #1 sets the standard in terms of uniform and reliable performance.The dense buds and plentiful harvests from Skunk #1 highlight the true significance of hybrid power. Although the plants gain more in height than pure indicas, the growth and flowering are typically indica. Which means: a short growth period is followed by an equally short flowering time of around 45 to 50 days. Skunk #1 Feminized produces strong stems and shoots to support their large yields. In small gaps between branches, the shoots expand to finished formations of buds that develop into powerfully heavy colas up until harvest. The sativa influence has a particular impact on the shape and structure of the buds.In a sunny, warm climate, these seeds thrive outside in the fresh air. Indoors, these plants are undemanding. We regularly hear from people who make a lot of growing mistakes, but achieve great results nevertheless. Skunk #1 is suitable for the most advanced cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG) and Lollipopping.

Some people like it, while others turn up their nose. Users report a sweet sharpness reminiscent of old-school hashish. Did you know?Skunk #1 has won multiple Cannabis Cup awards.
