Shiva Shanti Regular is 85% indica, which results in a powerful, calming body-stone. It’s an affordable, easy-to-grow strain which grows to average heights, and thrives in sunny climates. Growers often enjoy its sweet, sour aroma, and the pungent, skunky taste. Most people benefit from a big yield with Shiva Shanti Regular, without having to put too much effort in.Growth pattern of Shiva Shanti RegularShiva Shanti Regular cannabis seeds have mostly indica genetics. The strain was developed in the 1990s to celebrate the formation of the Sensi Seed Bank, and was bred from an Afghani plant called Garlic Bud, and a classic Kush variety.This is the regular variant of the strain, which makes it the preferred choice for growers wishing to generate their own seeds. In this pack, the seeds produce both male and female plants. Regular seeds are also suitable for those who want to experiment with cross-breeding with other strains.Shiva Shanti Regular has a relatively short flowering time, of just 50 to 55 days. This means that growers can reach the harvest stage relatively speedily. Thanks to their indica genetics, the plants don’t tend to reach towering heights; in fact, when grown indoors, it’s possible to limit their growth to just 100 to 160 cm. Outside, it’s likely that they’ll grow taller – to around 190 to 220 cm on average.Structurally, the plants are quite bushy, with dark, narrow leaves. They can be squat in appearance, with a thick central stem. Most of the buds form around this stem, and they’re usually large and dense. They’re also compact, and often spear-shaped. Growers report obtaining plentiful harvests from Shiva Shanti Regular, without having to put in too much effort. When cultivated inside, an average yield is about 500 gram per square metre, and outdoors, it’s around 500 grams per plant.This strain does particularly well in warm, sunny climates, like the Mediterranean. Due to their kush heritage, the plants are usually ready to harvest around late September / early October. They can also be grown indoors (all year round), or in a greenhouse. Their average height means that low ceilings or greenhouse roofs shouldn’t be an issue. Supercropping and lollipopping are both effective training techniques for Shiva Shanti Regular, and deliver good results. However, most growers can enjoy sizeable harvests without too much effort at all. Effect, taste, and smell of Shiva Shanti RegularShiva Shanti Regular is indica-dominant, and this comes through in the resulting high. It’s a potent, total-body stone, which users claim is calming, while also enhancing the physical senses. The 15% sativa influence adds a hint of uplift too. The plants don’t produce too much odour, which is useful for those who want to grow them without drawing any unwanted attention. However, they do produce some scent, and this is typically sour and sweet, with a skunky edge. After curing, the smell is less noticeable, but the tang of skunk is still very evident in the taste. Did you know?Shiva Shanti Regular was named after Sensi Seeds’ founder Ben Dronkers’ twin daughters. It also took its name from the Hindu god, who is commonly associated with cannabis. Some of the phenotypes release a noticeable garlicky scent.Due to Shiva Shanti Regular’s average height and unobtrusive aroma, it’s a favourite among growers that want to cultivate the plants discreetly. It’s considered an easy-to-maintain variety, which means it’s a popular choice for novice growers.
