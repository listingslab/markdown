Black Harlequin is the result of us crossbreeding our own Black Domina with US variety Harlequin. Due to its CBD content, Harlequin is one of the most popular CBD strains, and has won multiple awards (including Cannabis Cups). Harlequin’s traits are brought to a higher level with its marriage with Black Domina. Finally, we added the strength of Northern Lights #5 (also a multiple award winner) to Black Harlequin, bringing a new experience to CBD fans.Black Lights CBD Automatic is an indica / sativa / ruderalis hybrid. It’s an autoflowering variant, which means it’s super-easy to cultivate. The genetic heritage of Northern Lights #5 and Black Harlequin CBDexplains the THC to CBD ratio of 2:1, and the 12% to 15% THC levels. Users can expect a relaxing, happy high, with the plants producing a sweet, fruity scent. The strain grows well in cool and temperate climates. Growth pattern of Black Lights CBD Automatic This hybrid strain has impressive genetics, with parent plants including Cannabis Cup-winning Northern Lights #5, and The Black Harlequin. It has a THC to CBD ratio of 2:1, and THC levels of 12% to 15%. The seeds are feminized and automatic. This means that they’ll grow and flower like females, while their growth and flowering cycles aren’t affected by the amount of hours of light they get. The result? A strain that’s really easy to cultivate, even for beginners. The flowering period is 60 to 70 days, which is about average. Likewise, the plants tend to grow to average heights, and usually end up around 100 cm tall. This is thanks to the indica parentage, and means that they can be cultivated discreetly, both inside and outdoors. The plants are bushy and compact in appearance, with plenty of lateral branches. The buds are long and thick, and are generally quite plentiful by harvest-time. Though this is an autoflowering variant, the yields are still impressive. It’s not uncommon for growers to obtain around 450 g per square metre. Black Lights CBD Automatic produces robust plants, which are able to withstand even cold climates. They can also be cultivated indoors at any time of the year. Experienced growers can have success with cultivation techniques such as SOG (Sea of Green) and lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Black Lights CBD Automatic The strain is a blend of indica, sativa and ruderalis. The two main parent plants, Black Harlequin and the legendary Northern Lights #5, can be detected in the relaxing high, juicy scent, and fruity taste. Upon consumption, users often report a deeply relaxing, typically indica stone, followed by a welcome uplifting sensation. With THC levels of 12% to 15%, the relaxing effects of Black Lights CBD are pleasantly intense, without resulting in a total couch-lock. While the plants are growing, they produce a sweet, fruity aroma, which is fairly subtle. Again, this is beneficial for those wishing to cultivate the strain without attracting attention. The taste is similar to the smell, though the sweetness from the Black Harlequin parent really comes into the foreground, giving it a mouth-watering flavour.
