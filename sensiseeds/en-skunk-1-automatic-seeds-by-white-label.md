Even outdoors, several harvests per year are possible with these autoflowering seeds. Skunk #1 Automatic is a robust and easy-to-grow cannabis strain that yields dense, resin-covered buds. The effect combines a heady sativa high with a relaxing indica stone.Skunk #1 Automatic by White Label growth patternThe original Skunk #1 is the gold standard for uniform, fast-growing and high-yield cannabis strains. It forms the basis for countless modern hybrids. Developing an autoflowering version of this classic was a no-brainer. It comprises 35% sativa and 65% indica genes.Our breeders crossed the potent and consistent genome of Skunk #1 with that of a Ruderalis strain. The result: an even more robust, delightfully high-yield strain that’s still easy to grow. Skunk #1 Automatic cannabis seeds by White Label produce compact plants that, in flower, do not grow quite so high as regular Skunk #1. These autoflowering ladies still follow the strong growth pattern of skunk with their short internode gaps between strong branches laden with dense, succulent flower clusters. If Skunk #1 Auto is germinated in the springtime and planted outdoors, it may even be ready to harvest in cool regions in the June. Unlike traditional plants, the yield from autoflowering seeds is much lower, although more yields per year can be achieved when growing outdoors.As with all autoflowering cannabis strains, buds form automatically. With Skunk #1 Automatic by White Label, that happens in around the sixth week of the growth period, so around the time that the plants form their fifth to seventh set of true leaves. If grown indoors, the plants can reach full maturity within just seven weeks of the start of flowering, yielding a harvest of dense buds covered with trichomes. Skunk #1 Automatic is suitable for advanced growing and pruning techniques such as Sea of Green (SOG) and Lollipopping.
