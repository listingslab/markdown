Gorillaz Automatic cannabis seeds sprout into a beautiful plant with vibrant colours of green and purple. This strain combines the pleasure with a punch. Unique profiles make this an easy strain to desire. Gorillaz Automatic flowers are covered in resinous trichomes, giving these buds their potent effects. The happy and high-powered effects make Gorillaz Automatic an excellent option for daytime usage. Growth pattern of Gorillaz Automatic Gorillaz Automatic is an indica-dominant hybrid developed for our Breeding Grounds collaboration with Fat Beans with genetic contributions from Chemdawg, Sour Diesel and Chocolope. This plant can grow tall like a sativa, but the multiple branches and bushy structure give Gorillaz Auto more of an indica morphology. Internodal spacing is average, and the olive-green canopy can use occasional defoliation. Growers don’t need to change a light schedule to make Gorillaz Automatic start flowering. Because this variety is an automatic, the plant initiates this process itself. Roughly 42-49 days after that point, Gorillaz Automatic will be ready to harvest. Indoor growers can see plants 100-160 cm tall. Outdoor growers will see slightly larger plants, around 110-180 cm. Gorillaz Automatic can be grown outdoors in temperate / Continental climates.Gorillaz Automatic plants are covered in medium to large, chunky buds that swell with tightly packed bracts. The flowers are very resinous and capture the eye with a complimentary contrast between the vibrant shades of green and purple. With ideal conditions, indoor growers have reported large yields of 200-250 grams per m². Outdoor growers can see yields anywhere in the 75-200 grams per plant range with a good season.Effects, taste, and smell of Gorillaz AutomaticGorillaz Automatic is a powerful strain but not an uncomfortable strain.
