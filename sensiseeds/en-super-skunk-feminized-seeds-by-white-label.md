Super Skunk Feminized by White Label provides the heavy yields and potent high of original Super Skunk in a form that’s easy to grow and even more affordable. With its short flowering time and robust nature, this strain is unsurprisingly popular with growers of all experience levels. This is a great choice for anyone seeking large harvests of trichome-covered buds without a great deal of effort. Growth pattern of Super Skunk Feminized by White LabelWhite Label’s Super Skunk Feminized is 80% indica. As with other indica-dominant variants, the plants are sturdy and strong, with thick stems and branches. They produce large, heavy buds, which grow between the nodes during the flowering stage. The plant’s main cola, if left to its own devices, can take over the top stem. This means it’s well suited to methods such as trimming, fimming, pinching out or topping. These create multiple stems. More experienced growers may achieve good results with lollipopping, and with the Sea of Green (SOG) and Screen of Green (SCROG) techniques. Super Skunk Feminized cannabis seeds grow into average sized plants. They have a short flowering period (around 45 to 50 days), which is surprising, given how plentiful their yields are, and how dense and chunky the buds are. This is due to the Afghan parentage, which has been bred with the original Skunk strain to bring out the indica elements. Beginners can achieve good results with this strain, and experienced growers can definitely capitalise on the plants’ full potential. This strain is well suited to being cultivated indoors (typical for a Skunk variant). However, it is possible to grow the plants outdoors, providing they’re in a climate that benefits from warm, long summers. Super Skunk Feminized thrives in pots, where it will become large and bushy whether outdoors or inside under lights. Outdoors in free soil, the height is likely to be far greater. The strain is also well-suited for growing in greenhouses, though it’s recommended that the plants are kept short, to prevent the plants from pushing against the roof. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk Feminized by White LabelWhite Label’s Super Skunk Feminized, unlike some other types of skunk, has an almost tropical scent, especially after it has been cured. While growing, it produces a pungent, sweet aroma, with nutty, earthy base notes. Once the flowers start to emerge, growers will detect a hint of the classic skunk smell: astringent and immediately recognisable. The scent can become intense, especially during the flowering stage. As this is only seven weeks, indoor growers shouldn’t find it too problematic, as long as they have carbon filters on their air extraction. Many users recommend giving the harvested buds time to cure properly. This enables them to develop a full flavour profile. Upon consumption, Super Skunk Feminized offers a potent relaxing effect, which relieves feelings of stress, and muscle tension. Some people recommend it as the perfect evening strain, as it can also bring about a sense of jollity and fun. Did you know?
