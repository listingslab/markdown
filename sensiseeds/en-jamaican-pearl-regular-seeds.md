Do you like tropical sativas but live in a grey European climate? The answer is Jamaican Pearl Regular cannabis seeds. This resistant, early-flowering strain can be grown outdoors in most climates. Thanks to 85% sativa genes, it delivers a mood-lifting high.Jamaica is home to a number of tropical sativas that have been planted and perfected over many years. So it’s all the more surprising that modern cannabis cultivation includes only a few Caribbean strains. Our Marley’s Collie has countless fans, so we really wanted to bring a new strain to the market.It’s bred for easy growth, suitable for the European climate, yet boasts that irresistible tropical flavour. It certainly wasn’t an easy undertaking, but when you think that nowadays, Jamaican Pearl is one of our most popular outdoor strains, we can proudly say that we have achieved our goal. Starting with Marley’s Collie, we found the perfect pollen donor in our Early Pearl. It produces fast-flowering and tough offspring, and as a tropical sativa male, it dilutes neither the tropical flavour nor the cerebral, energetic high. Jamaican Pearl Regular growth patternOur tests generate uniform, strong plants with fast growing behaviour and the desired combination of taste, effect and weight. Jamaican Pearl cannabis seeds produce tall plants that can reach up to 300 cm outside. The flowering phase lasts between 50 and 75 days, producing plentiful large, shaggy buds.This strain of course also thrives indoors under artificial light. The ceiling of the growing room must be high enough, however. A Screen of Green (SCROG) may also help. Good results can also be achieved with special pruning methods such as Supercropping and Lollipopping.Effect, flavour and smell of Jamaican Pearl RegularWith 85% sativa genes, Jamaican Pearl Regular delivers just the high you’d expect: mood-lifting, positive and energetic but not as hard-hitting as certain THC-rich Haze strains. The effect is felt primarily in the head, but is always manageable and won’t stop you getting on with other things. You can enjoy this cannabis strain morning, noon and night.We were very keen to capture the tropical flavour of Jamaican sativa. The best Jamaican Pearl Regular phenotypes smell sweet, fruity and earthy all at once – a little like a mild summer’s evening in the Caribbean. To fully savour the flavour notes, consume this weed in a vaporiser.Did you know?Jamaican Pearl is one of our award-winning cannabis strains. At the Highlife Festival, it took 1st prize in two categories. But if you prefer something easier to grow, you can also order this strain as Jamaican Pearl Feminized.
