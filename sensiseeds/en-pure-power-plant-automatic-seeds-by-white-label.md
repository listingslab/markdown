Pure Power Plant Automatic by White Label combines the best of both worlds; ease of cultivation and an intense, energising high. The plants have a wonderfully distinctive peppery, spicy scent, and the buds have delicious notes of citrus. Thanks to its indica parentage, it’s a compact strain and can be grown discreetly. The incorporation of ruderalis genetics means that the plants flourish even in colder climates. Growth pattern of Pure Power Plant AutomaticWhite Label Pure Power Plant Auto cannabis seeds combine indica genetics (50%) with sativa and ruderalis (30% and 20% respectively). This popular strain was developed in the 1990s, and since then, has been a firm favourite with growers across the world. The balance of indica and sativa offers the benefits of both cannabis types; compact size and faster growth, combined with a more invigorating high. The plants are also 20% ruderalis, which makes them hardier and more robust. It’s an autoflowering strain, which makes it suitable for novice growers. The sturdy plants grow quickly: Expect flowering to start approximately three or four weeks from the time of germination, with the flowering period lasting around 45-55 days. The complete growth cycle is about 70 days from seed to harvest, which is ideal for those that want fast results. Some growers make the most of this rapid growth to enjoy multiple harvests each year. The indica genes of White Label’s Pure Power Plant Auto means that the plants are typically compact in size. In fact, most only grow to around 80 to 100 cm, which means they can be cultivated discreetly in a greenhouse or garden. Indoors, they’re usually even shorter, with an average height of around 50 to 70 cm. This is advantageous if space is limited. The plants are largely indica in structure too, with a ‘pine tree’ shape, and short internodal gaps. There doesn’t tend to be too much side-branching either. In terms of yield, growers can anticipate generating around 250 to 400 grams per square metre, or 120 to 180 grams when grown outside. When the buds start to develop, the sativa genetics become more apparent. Expect them to be covered in trichomes that are dense, sticky and plentiful. However, the buds are compact too (which is more typical of indica varieties).Pure Power Plant Automatic is a hardy, robust strain, and thrives well in most climates; even those with cooler, shorter summers. The plants need plenty of ventilation towards the end of the blooming stage, to avoid any issues with mould. Aside from this, they’re exceptionally easy to grow.
