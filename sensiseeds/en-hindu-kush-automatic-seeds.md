Even if you make cultivation mistakes, it won’t really be a problem because this strain is wonderfully robust. Hindu Kush Auto ensures added resistance and reliability.

The short flowering time of 45 to 50 days allows for several harvests from the same area. These short, bushy plants are a big advantage in interior spaces with low ceilings. In warm regions with plenty of sunshine, Hindu Kush Automatic cannabis seeds also flourish outside. With its strong branches, this strain is excellent for Sea of Green (SOG) or Lollipopping.
