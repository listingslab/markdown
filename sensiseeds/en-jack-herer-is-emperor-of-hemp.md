The best-selling book “The Emperor Wears No Clothes” by Jack Herer blew the lid off the anti-hemp conspiracy and explained all there is to know about an easy-to-grow plant with infinite, non-intoxicating uses. Why is hemp illegal? The information is in this film … and you won’t believe it!This DVD is about a man’s fight for truth, justice … and a plant. What began as his singular battle has turned into a massive movement to educate America about this environmentally friendly, beneficial plant. “Emperor of Hemp” exposes government and big-business efforts to keep the plant illegal, and takes you to the front lines of the pro-hemp movement.
