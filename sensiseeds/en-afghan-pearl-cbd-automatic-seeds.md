Afghan Pearl CBD is 60% indica, 40% sativa. It has an impressive parentage, with a Hindu Kush CBD plant resulting in a THC / CBD ratio of 1:1 to 2:1. The effect is ideal for those seeking relaxation, but it also offers a sense of euphoria, thanks to award-winning Jamaican Pearl’s influence. This strain grows well in temperate and continental climates. Growth pattern of Afghan Pearl CBD AutomaticAfghan Pearl CBD Automatic cannabis seeds are 60% indica, 40% sativa. The ratio of THC to CBD is 1:1 to 2:1 (depending on the phenotype), and is usually in the range of 12% to 16% THC. The feminized trait is advantageous to less experienced growers, as it means there’s no need to remove male plants to maximise harvests. The seeds are also autoflowering, which makes them even easier to cultivate. The plants have a flowering period of 70 to 75 days. They grow to around 80 to 100cm, and don’t need excessive space to thrive in. This strain is capable of producing good-sized yields (around 400 grams /m2 ) and as such, growers can anticipate seeing lots of resinous, compact buds on the plants during the flowering stage. For the best results possible, the plants should be grown in temperate or continental climates, but they can also be cultivated indoors all year round. Experienced growers may want to experiment with the SOG (Sea of Green) or lollipopping cultivation techniques to further enhance their yield. Effect, taste, and smell of Afghan Pearl CBD AutomaticAfghan Pearl CBD Auto is 60% indica and 40% sativa, which is a fairly balanced hybrid. The CBD is evident in the high, though the other parent plants can also be detected in the effect, scent and flavour. Caribbean strains such as Jamaican Pearl are renowned as powerful sativa cultivars. Thanks to the influence of Jamaican Pearl, users report feeling relaxed and happy after consuming this strain, with a distinct experience of euphoria. The full-body sense of relaxation usually takes a while to kick in, but is intense when it does so. Growers can expect an aroma that’s fruity, citrussy and sweet, and which usually intensifies as the buds reach harvest time. The taste is much the same, with notes of citrus, spice and wood from the Hindu Kush CBD parent. CBD cannabis strain enthusiasts are in for a treat, as they can finally enjoy the tropical flavours of Jamaican Pearl, and a gentler version of its cheery cerebral effects.
