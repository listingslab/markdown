CBD Oil 10% is made from hemp grown in the EU, with added certified organic hempseed oil. It’s a low-THC product (under 0.05%), and it’s full of high-quality cannabidiol. This CBD Oil is also suitable for vegans. How is CBD Oil 10% produced?Our CBD Oil is extracted using the most effective methods, to ensure it retains its quality. Firstly, we harvest the hemp leaves and let them dry for four hours. Then, we press the hemp leaves into pellets. The key ingredients are drawn out of the pellets using a process called supercritical CO2 extraction. These ingredients are dehydrated and decarboxylated, which produces the CBD. We mix it with organic hempseed oil, which helps your body to absorb it more effectively. Our CBD Oil contains not just cannabidiol, but also several other phytocannabinoids, such as cannabichromene (CBC), cannabigerol (CBG) and cannabinol (CBN). It also contains terpenes, including limonene, myrcene, linalool, alpha and beta-pinene, phytol, humulene, caryophyllene oxide and caryophyllene. There are other natural substances too: nitrogenous compounds, amino acids and sugars, ketones, flavonoids, vitamins, glycosides, alkanes, aldehydes and pigments.The appearance and aroma of CBD Oil 10% This food supplement contains 10% (1000 mg) CBD, which makes it our strongest CBD Oil. We also offer our CBD Oil in 5% and 2.75% versions. Alternatively, for a larger bottle of 10% CBD, check out our 30ml option, or our CBD capsules. You’ll notice that this tincture is greenish-brown, and sometimes there is some plant sediment at the bottom. This is nothing to be concerned about; it’s exactly what the product is meant to look like. The aroma is herbal, with grassy, dank notes. In summary…10% CBD Oil is available in two sizes: 10 ml (1000 mg) and 30 ml (3000 mg)The added hempseed oil is certified organicIt’s suitable for a vegan lifestyleThis product only contains only a trace of THC
