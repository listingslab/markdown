Super Skunk Feminized lives up to its name, and is one of our most popular strains. Super harvests of chunky buds, super easy to grow, and (obviously) a super member of the skunk family! We gave the original Skunk #1 a boost to its yield and effects: We crossed it with a carefully chosen Afghan, then feminized the result so there’s no need to remove males. As an indica-dominant cannabis strain it’s reliably relaxing, with a 20% sativa component that lifts your mood and keeps lethargy away.Growth pattern of Super Skunk FeminizedSensi Seeds bred Super Skunk Feminized cannabis seeds were created to be a stronger, heavier-yielding version of the world-famous Skunk #1. Adding genetics from a pure-bred resinous Afghan hash plant achieved this. As with all feminised seeds, a major advantage is not having to identify and remove the male plants, providing an easy cultivation option for less experienced growers. However, this isn’t the only benefit that Super Skunk Feminized offers. The seeds produce an extremely uniform crop, which only grows to average heights during the flowering stage. Sturdy and conical in appearance, the plants are usually ready to harvest at the same time; and at the same height, making the process easier for growers. This reliability, combined with the shorter stature, is useful for gardeners who want to use the Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG) techniques to cultivate the plants, or who are looking for the homogeneity of a clone plant, with the simplicity of growing from seed. Super Skunk Feminized has a relatively short flowering period of 50 days maximum. This works well for indoor growers who want to enjoy two or even three harvests per year. Once the flowers start growing, they increase in size very quickly. They also multiply so rapidly that progress can sometimes be observed from one day to the next. The buds are a striking bright green colour, and are spiky, with large, pointy calyxes. Growers can anticipate generating large yields, even those with little experience behind them. The skunk family was initially bred to be a good indoors option; Super Skunk Feminized is an excellent example of the success of this effort. However, that doesn’t mean that the plants have to be grown inside. In Mediterranean climates, for example, Super Skunk Feminized will thrive outdoors. It also does well in a greenhouse. When grown in these conditions, it’s not uncommon for the plants to grow to the size of small trees, especially if the summer is long and warm. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk FeminizedTypically, skunk strains tend to produce a pungent odour (hence the name). Super Skunk Feminized is rather different, with a smoother, fruitier aroma. The Afghan parentage shines through, with earthy, spicy base-notes which are particularly strong during the flowering period. Indoor growers should be aware that this smell intensifies as harvest approaches. Once the buds are cured, they produce a more mellow version of the original scent, which is echoed in the taste. The citrus sweetness complements the warmer earthy notes perfectly. As for the effects that Super Skunk Feminized produces, most users describe it as a blend of uplifting contentment and relaxation. The euphoric lift is due to the sativa content, while the dominant indica genetics create a sense of calm. Some users value this strain for its ability to counteract feelings of stress and tension.
