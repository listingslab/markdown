Jack Flash #5 Feminized is a skilful blend of Jack Herer (one of Sensi Seeds’ most popular strains), a Super Skunk and a Haze. This results in a 65% indica, 35% sativa that produces bumper harvests, while being easy to grow. Thanks to the sativa influence, the plants can sometimes reach towering heights, though can be kept more compact indoors. The high is reportedly happy, stimulating and euphoric. Growth pattern of Jack Flash #5 FeminizedJack Flash #5 Feminized cannabis seeds are 65% indica, 35% sativa. The strain was developed by Sensi Seeds, using the popular Jack Herer genetics, combined with a Super Skunk and a Haze variety. It presents itself in two phenotypes; one that is more typically indica (compact, stocky, with large buds), and one that’s taller, and requires more room to flourish. This is the feminized version of the strain. As such, the seeds are very unlikely to produce male plants, which makes cultivation much easier. This is beneficial for those that aren’t looking to produce seeds of their own, and who want reliability and predictability during cultivation. Jack Flash #5 Feminized has a relatively short flowering time of 55 to 75 days. The phenotype that’s more skunk-like in personality tends to be shorter. When grown in optimum conditions indoors, its height can be limited to around 100 cm. The taller phenotype produces much better results when given room to grow. Outside, these plants can reach heights of 180 to 250 cm (indoors, up to 180 cm). Structurally, both phenotypes differ quite significantly. The sativa-type is slender, with thin lateral branches. These branches are densely covered in weighty buds, which take on the classic spiral formation. The indica-type is squatter and bushier, with huge, fat calyxes. Jack Flash #5 Feminized is a big yielder, which is a major draw for growers. Outside, plants reliably produce around 600 grams each, which is a sizeable harvest indeed. Towards the end of the flowering period, the buds are heavy, massive and coated in resin. This strain performs best in countries with long, warm, sunny summers, such as those in the Mediterranean. The plants also grow well inside, or in a greenhouse. The indica phenotype is ideal for the SOG (Sea of Green) system, though growers report good results from SCROG (Screen of Green), lollipopping, and supercropping too. Effect, taste, and smell of Jack Flash #5 FeminizedJack Flash #5 Feminized is a 65% indica and 35% sativa strain. This blend really comes out in the high, which users claim is stimulating, cerebral and happy, whilst having a relaxing effect too. There’s also a mild psychedelic aspect to this strain, and it often promotes a sense of chattiness and thoughtfulness. As such, it’s well suited to social occasions. The aroma of the growing plants is fairly noticeable; a distinctive pine scent, with undertones of citrus and earth. This is particularly evident after the buds are cured, and can also be detected in the taste. Did you know?One of Jack Flash #5 Feminized’s parents is Jack Herer, which is one of Sensi Seeds’ most well-known strains.Although Jack Flash #5 Feminized is easy to grow, it’s a strain that’s more suited to those with a level of experience.
