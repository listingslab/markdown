White Gold Feminized by White Label is known for its first-rate resin production, XXL harvests, high THC content and sweet flavour.White Gold Feminized by White Label growth patternThe name of this cannabis strain is derived from the names of its parent plants. White Gold was created by crossing a White Widow with Himalayan Gold. The result is a wonderful hybrid that is based on 60% indica and 40% sativa genes, and that is in no way inferior to its famous parents. The medium-sized plants result in average height gain during the flowering stage. In common with many indica-heavy strains, the leaves and buds can take on a purple tone – provided it’s not too warm. It’s time to harvest when the buds are covered with a syrupy resin. That generally takes seven to nine weeks. It is characterised by long, dark and furry buds with orange-coloured pistils. White Gold Feminized by White Label really plays its aces when it comes to trichomes and yield. Likes its well-known mother, White Widow, it produces copious resin from which hashish can be created, and which also lends the buds their great potency. Because the feminized version of White Gold is relatively undemanding and delivers large yields, it is equally popular among commercial growers and novices alike. It is primarily a plant for indoor cultivation, but can also be grown outdoors in sunny and warm climates. The best results are achieved with a SOG (Sea of Green) or SCROG (Screen of Green). However, the plants also flourish wonderfully in a conventional set-up or hydroponic system. Effect, flavour and smell of White Gold Feminized by White LabelDo you like to be creative? Then you’ll appreciate the hybrid effect. Some caution is urged however, since this cannabis strain has a high THC content, which can result in unwanted side effects in some people.The taste and smell of this strain captivate with a tropical and fruity tone, accentuated by a Haze smell and earthy notes. In this respect, it clearly differentiates itself by White Widow, which has a more neutral, some would even say more boring flavour. Warning: these seeds are not the right choice for stealth growers who value discretion. The growing plants smell too strong for that.Did you know?We also sell White Gold Regular by White Label seeds.
