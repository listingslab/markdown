The DaVinci IQ2 vaporizer takes the sleek, elegant design of the original IQ and updates it for the next generation of cannabis users. This pocket-sized portable vaporizer has a minimalist, streamlined exterior and an interior featuring an all-ceramic vapour path and a glass-lined ceramic bowl. Combined with the adjustable air flow and precision temperature control, this makes the IQ2 first choice for obtaining all the flavours and effects of cannabis.The DaVinci IQ2 has broken new ground in the field of vaporiser technology. Not only can you control the temperature of the oven, you can also receive information about the dosage of cannabinoids per draw; the length of time you are inhaling; and the length of the session for one dose. Inputting the strength of the cannabis allows the DaVinci IQ2 to track your usage. You can even set an alarm to let you know when your desired dosage has been reached. This is a great advantage for medicinal users, as is the heat-up time of less than 60 seconds and the easy-to-fill design. It comes with a ten-year warranty for years of satisfying use.
