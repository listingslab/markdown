SENSI #1318 CBD Harlequin x Black Domina is the result of a challenging breeding program in which we combined one of the strongest CBD varieties from the USA with one of the strongest Afghani strains from the Sensi Seed Bank.Harlequin is a standout variety in terms of reliable CBD levels, and a cerebral, pleasantly alert high with the relaxing effects of the indica powerhouse which is Black Domina. This award-winning strain brings all the elements of a powerful Afghani to the table: a short flowering time, a compact bud structure, a pungent flavour and a strong body high.The result of this cross is a relaxing, balanced hybrid with a 1:1 THC to CBD ratio. Its complex flavour mixes the Black Domina’s pungent and earthy undertones with the Harlequin’s woody and flowery notes.
