This strain boasts some impressive parent plants, such as the award-winning NYC Diesel, Hindu Kush, White Widow, and Maple Leaf Indica. It’s 60% indica, which explains the relaxed couch-lock high, though the 20% sativa influence is evident in the euphoric effect. It’s also 20% ruderalis, and as an automatic variant, it thrives in most climates. The plants are compact enough to be grown discreetly, and produce a citrussy, tropical aroma. The dynasty of Punch strains is one of the new cannabis trends from the US, which provides fruity flavours to other strains. Mandarin Punch is a new addition to the line, highlighting sweetly citrus mandarin aromas in its makeup.Growth pattern of Mandarin Punch Automatic This strain, developed by Sensi Seeds, has a formidable genetic pool. Its parent plants include White Widow, Maple Leaf Indica, NYC Diesel, and Hindu Kush; strains that are highly regarded throughout the world. It’s 60% indica, 20% sativa, and 20% ruderalis. The indica dominance is evident in the appearance of the plants, which are short and sturdy, and the stone, which is a potent couch-lock. However, the sativa influence can also be felt in the sense of euphoria and happiness. The seeds are feminized and auto-flowering, which means that they’re easy to grow, even for complete beginners. The plants have a flowering time of 9 weeks (63 days), and are compact in size, even when they reach full maturity. This is advantageous for growers who want to cultivate them discreetly, either indoors or outside. Visually, they resemble other indica-dominant varieties, with a thick central stem and plenty of bushy branches. The buds usually form around the central cola, rather than on the branches themselves. Growers can expect to generate a relatively good-sized yield, especially given that this is an autoflowering strain. One of the main benefits of an automatic is its ability to thrive in most climates, and this strain is no exception. The plants are likely to grow well in the majority of locations, even in countries with cooler, shorter summers. They can respond well to most popular cultivation techniques, like SOG (Sea of Green), supercropping and lollipopping, once growers have gained a little experience.

However, the sativa influence can also be detected in the sense of euphoria and creativity.
