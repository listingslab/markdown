With a delicious flavour that is very close to the original Haze strains, White Regular by White Label excites discerning sativa fans. The flowering time is relatively long, rewarded by sticky super buds that awaken a sense of adventure.Amnesia White Regular by White Label marks a further development of the original Haze genetics. It combines the psychedelic tingle of Haze with the resin production, speed and potential yield of an indica. To ensure that none of the delicious Haze high and flavour is lost, these regular cannabis seeds contain a racy Thai strain in addition to an Afghan plant. Amnesia White Regular by White Label growth patternThe result is a sativa hybrid (70% sativa, 30% indica) that continues the Haze cannabis success story. Amnesia White Regular by White Label produces buds that grow into a point and that are so heavy with resin that they sparkle like gemstones. Compared with traditional Haze strains, both the flowering time and the height have been reduced – while increasing yields!Indoors, the plants reach around 120 to 160 cm in height, and can be harvested after 60 to 80 days. All this can be reduced further with a short vegetation phase and a Screen of Green (SCROG), where the tips of the plants are secured to mesh netting. This cannabis strain is also suitable for a Sea of Green (SOG). This cultivation method sees up to 25 plants placed under a light source. Clones from regular cannabis seeds produce strong and resilient plants. They need to be well ventilated to prevent pests and mould. That is of course less of a problem outside in the fresh air. Outdoor growing will be successful only in a sunny or Mediterranean climate, however. In California, Amnesia White Regular by White Label can reach over 3 m high. Effect, flavour and smell of Amnesia White Regular by White LabelIt was clear from the outset that Amnesia White Regular by White Label had to retain the psychedelic and electrifying Haze high. ‘Amnesia’ of course means ‘memory loss’. With a THC content of up to 20%, it’s possible to lose the plot somewhat. Here’s a little tip: cannabis is easiest measured out in a vaporizer. This enables the fantastic flavour nuances of this strain to unfold.The flavour and smell are almost identical to original Haze strains. Spicy, underlaid with nuances of citrus fruits and an earthy sweetness. Did you know?It’s no secret that Jimi Hendrix was a big Haze fan. Hendrix didn’t take his inspiration for ‘Purple Haze’ from a cannabis buzz though, but rather from a Science Fiction novel. Sensi Seeds and White Label offer a broad selection of Haze strains, including award-winning strains such as Silver Haze Regular and White Haze Regular by White Label.
