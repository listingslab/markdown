Skunk #1 Regular is the world’s first stable indica-sativa hybrid. These regular cannabis seeds produce exceptionally strong and uniform plants that flower after just 45 to 50 days.Skunk #1 Regular growth patternThe original skunk hybrids fused traditional landraces from Central and South America, Afghanistan and Thailand. Through several generations of intensive selection and countless backcrossing, our genetics experts successfully managed to stabilise the very best examples of skunk. The result: the world’s first natural sativa-indica hybrid – Skunk #1 (35% sativa, 65% indica).The growth and flowering reflect the typically indica characteristics. During the flowering stage, Skunk #1 does not grow much taller than a pure indica strain. The wonderful leaves originate from its Afghan predecessors. They turn darker as the plant ages – from a fresh lime green to a deep dark green.The consistent performance and rich harvest demonstrate the true significance of hybrid power. Robust stems and branches form fast to support the heavy buds. Flowering starts very quickly, and is relatively short at 45 to 50 days. The sativa heritage is evident in the plentiful long stems as much as in the calyxes. The same is true of the explosive reach of the resinous buds shortly before harvest time. Beholding the colourful goings-on brings true delight.Skunk #1 Regular flourishes outdoors in moderate climates with long summers. These seeds also perform well indoors under lamps. Because regular cannabis seeds produce exceptionally strong plants, Skunk #1 Regular is the perfect candidate for advanced trim and cultivation techniques such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Lollipopping and Supercropping. Effect, flavour and smell of Skunk #1 RegularThe sativa genes have a wonderful influence on potency and effect: it’s a combination of a creative, long-lasting high and relaxed stone. In terms of taste, earthy and sweet notes are perceptible. Anyone who has ever tried skunk will know what to expect.Did you know?These winners of various Harvest Festivals and Cannabis Cups have been among our best sellers for many years. Skunk strains are particularly popular in the hip-hop scene. Just think how often the word comes up in rap texts. This cannabis strain is also available as Skunk #1 Feminized, Skunk #1 Automatic, Skunk #1 Feminized from White Label and Skunk #1 Automatic from White Label.
