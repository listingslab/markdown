White Label’s Purple Haze Feminized takes its name from the classic Jimi Hendrix song. As the name implies, it tends to have eye-catching purple flowers, and produces big yields. It’s sativa dominant, which means a chatty, energetic high. This means that it’s perfect for social situations. The sweet-and-sour aroma and short flowering times make this a firm favourite with growers across the globe. Growth pattern of Purple Haze FeminizedPurple Haze Feminized by White Label cannabis seeds are 80% sativa and 20% indica. Its sativa genetics really come to the foreground in the high, which is uplifting and energising. The strain has an impressive background, and is a hybrid of Purple Thai and a Haze variety. This parentage is evident in the sweet, tangy aroma, not to mention the violet-coloured flowers. It’s a feminized version of the strain, which means that the seeds are highly unlikely to produce any male plants. This makes cultivation much simpler. Purple Haze Feminized has a relatively quick flowering time of around 50 to 65 days. The plants are shorter than most Haze strains, which makes them more manageable if space is limited. Usually, they’ll reach around 110 to 150 cm in height. In terms of appearance, they have long internodal spaces and lateral branches. The long flowers are fluffy and tend to have distinctive purple colour running through them. White Label’s Purple Haze Feminized produces decent yields, which makes it popular with growers. Anticipate around 100 grams from each plant, or three to six ounces per square foot, regardless of whether it’s grown indoors or out. The buds usually have a spade-like structure, and are quite dense and heavy. In order to thrive outdoors, this strain needs a warm, sunny climate such as the Mediterranean. However, it can be grown indoors all year round. The SCROG (Screen of Green) and SOG (Sea of Green) growing systems both work well with Purple Haze Feminized, and the plants respond well to lollipopping and supercropping.
