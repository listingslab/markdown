Northern Lights #5 x Haze was created using the genetics of one of the world’s most popular strains: Northern Lights. The award-winning NL5 X Haze plants are 70% sativa, 30% indica, and can produce bountiful yields, year after year. They reach impressive heights, even indoors, and have a pleasantly spicy, sweet scent. Upon consuming, users report feeling euphoric to start with, then blissfully relaxed for a long time afterwards.Growth pattern of Northern Lights #5 x HazeNorthern Lights #5 x Haze cannabis seeds (or NL5 x Haze for short) are a blend of 70% sativa and 30% indica. This combination results in a plant that’s capable of reaching massive heights, and which produces plenty of dense buds. Although the hybrid strain was developed several years ago, it remains a firm favourite with growers across the globe. This is the regular variant of NL5 x Haze, which means the seeds will produce both male and female plants. The advantage of this is that the plants can be used to generate seeds for future grows. They can also be used to experiment with further hybridisation. Northern Lights #5 x Haze has a slightly longer flowering time of 65 to 75 days. As the plants mature, they grow extremely tall. This is especially the case when grown outdoors, with some growers reporting that their plants reach as high as 250 to 300 cm. Indoors, the height is less extensive, with average plants growing to around 120 to 170 cm, depending on when it is put into flowering. The strain is typically sativa in appearance, with long branches, but these are soon concealed by the densely packed, plentiful buds. As time goes on, the buds develop a sticky, resinous coating, more reminiscent of an indica than a sativa. One of the main attractions of Northern Lights #5 x Haze is its extra-large yields. When cultivated indoors, growers can anticipate harvesting around 450 grams per square metre. Outdoors, experienced growers report that the yield can be as much as 800 grams per plant. Due to its extended flowering period, NL5 x Haze needs to grow in a country that has long, warm summers. It can be grown indoors all year round. Growers often keep their plants small by changing the lights to 12/12 h after germination. Both supercropping and lollipopping deliver good results with this strain. Effect, taste, and smell of Northern Lights #5 x HazeNorthern Lights #5 x Haze is a sativa-dominant strain. This is immediately noticeable in the high, which is euphoric, social and happy. However, the indica genetics kick in a while later, when users report a total-body sense of relaxation, which lasts a long time. The strain’s aroma is fairly potent, especially towards harvesting. It’s sweet, exotic and spicy, and the Haze scent really comes through after the buds have been cured. Expect much the same in terms of taste, and be aware that the smell produced when smoking NL5 x Haze is quite powerful! Did you know?Northern Lights #5 x Haze is an award-winning strain.
