Finest Haze genetics meet Thai, Jamaican and Colombian: Eagle Bill® Regular enchants sativa fans with a fully rounded flavour of pine forest. This strain goes hand-in-hand with a vaporizer.Eagle Bill® Regular growth patternSensi Seeds has spared no effort and cost in developing this cannabis strain. It combines top genetics from Thailand, Jamaica and Colombia with the sativa inheritance of a pure resin strain. The result: a strong, resinous hybrid strain with 70% sativa.This is reflected in the growth pattern of these regular cannabis seeds, which produce both male and female plants. Following germination, they waste no time in quickly gaining height. The wide internode gaps and spiral shape of the buds are evident even from the start of the flowering time. The buds subsequently become more compact and robust – only now is the indica influence apparent. The flowering time is average at 60 to 70 days. Eagle Bill Amato was an unbelievably relaxed guy who didn’t understand the meaning of rushing anything. Accordingly, this cannabis strain also requires patience. The unique flavour develops only when the plants have finished flowering. But it is all the more prevalent as a result. The vegetation period can be kept short, which makes sense in smaller growing spaces with little ceiling height in particular. Supercropping is also appropriate in this respect. Experienced growers report larger harvests if the plants are cultivated in a Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG). What many people do not know: These cultivation methods also work outside in the open air – given sufficient sunshine and a long summer. Effect, flavour and smell of Eagle Bill® RegularEveryone who knew Bill knew he was a gourmet. He could identify and articulate even the smallest of flavour nuances. Unfortunately, he never got to try his own strain. The intensive pine flavour of Eagle Bill® is best experienced in a vaporizer. It is intensive, without being overpowering.The effect is typically sativa. Perfect as a creative strain during the day, Eagle Bill® delivers a stimulating, cerebral high that triggers real bursts of energy in some people. That sport and cannabis don’t go together is definitely a misconception.Did you know?Eagle Bill is known as the ‘Father of Vapour’. Long before vaping became trendy, he drew attention to the benefits of vaping at the Cannabis College in Amsterdam. There are videos doing the rounds on the internet showing Bill and his home-made vaporizer. With great patience, he explains to viewers how the device works. One of his best known partners in dialogue was Paris Hilton. Not that Bill understood and far less cared that he was talking to a famous society star.
