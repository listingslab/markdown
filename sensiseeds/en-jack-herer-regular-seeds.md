Jack Herer® Regular cannabis seeds produce tall and early-flowering plants with a high THC content. The lasting effect is felt in both the mind and the body; another reason why Jack has made a name for itself as a medicinal cannabis strain.Jack Herer® Regular growth patternWith 50% sativa and 50% indica genes, Jack Herer® Regular belongs to the group of cannabis hybrids. The attributes of one or the other dominate depending on the phenotype, allowing growers to select mother plants according to their preference. Three of the four main types are heavily sativa-influenced, while the fourth demonstrates indica-dominated growth behaviour: fast-growing, compact, with a thick bud structure. The fantastic resin production of this cannabis strain amazes even experienced growers. At their peak, the buds are so heavy with trichomes that they look as though they have been glazed. This crystal coating extends to the spear leaves, fan leaves and even to the main stems and stalks. All the phenotypes have the potential to produce a lush yield per metre, though growing experience definitely makes a difference with this strain. On average, it takes 10 to 12 weeks until harvest. Experts can optimise their results with a Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG) to improve the plants’ yield and restrict their height gain. Jack likes it hot – in Mediterranean or tropical climates it will also thrive outside in the sun. Effect, flavour and smell of Jack Herer® Regular	Are you ready for a full charge of hybrid power? This weed delivers a stratospheric cerebral high and a tremendous body buzz. Smokers can expect to feel an earthquake beneath their feet while their mind floats high up into the clouds.

Its complex aromatic bouquet, with sharp, savoury and earthy notes, only develops after harvesting.Did you know?Over the years, Jack Herer® has won just about every prestigious award going. But the highlight of its illustrious career wasn’t a Cannabis Cup, but the moment the Dutch authorities approved it as a medicinal cannabis strain.
