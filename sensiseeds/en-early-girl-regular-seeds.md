The fastest indica hybrid from Sensi Seeds is as uncomplicated as it is reliable. Early Girl Regular produces resilient and uniform plants which can also tolerate low temperatures. Suitable for novices and growers who value high yields.Early Girl Regular growth patternWith 75% indica and 25% sativa genes, Early Girl Regular is known as an extremely stable strain. Homogeneous plants with minimal differences make cannabis cultivation child’s play. These regular seeds produce compact plants with average height gain and an incredibly short flowering time. Seven to eight weeks is a record!The influence of Afghan strains is evident in the dark, broad-bladed fan leaves and the short internode gaps. But the Early Girl Regular also includes north Indian races and a Mexican sativa of the highest order. You can rightly assume that this girl is a fighter! Cold, temperature fluctuations and rain can’t touch it. Early Girl Regular is the perfect partner for anything living in a cold climate. Conceived as an outdoor strain, it cuts a fine figure on a balcony or in a garden, whatever the weather. A spot in the sunshine, water, some fertiliser – that’s all it needs. These regular seeds, which produce male and female plants, can of course also be grown indoors under artificial light. The large buds develop with a single main stem. Early Girl Regular quickly and reliably produces a large yield with very little care and attention.Effect, flavour and smell of Early Girl RegularConsumption of the dried buds results in a mild buzz coupled with a slightly euphoric feeling. Perfect for relaxed chilling, without getting completely wasted. The earthy and sweet taste is reminiscent of hashish. This is underpinned by a fine citrus flavour that originates from the Mexican mother plant of Early Pearl.Did you know?These seeds grow like the clappers and are ready to harvest in record time. Growers for whom that isn’t fast enough, or who want several yields each year, should choose an autoflowering strain. Sensi Seeds offers a broad selection of suitable strains.
