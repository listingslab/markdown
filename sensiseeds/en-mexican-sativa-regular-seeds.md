Mexican Sativa Regular cannabis seeds are easy to grow, affordable and ideal even in cold climates. The tall, elegant plants produce weed with an aroma that differs from typical Haze strains.Mexican Sativa Regular growth patternSo how did we succeed in getting this exotic cannabis strain acclimatised to northern climates? By crossing an original, little-known strain from Oaxaca with the robust African sativa strain Durban. To shorten the flowering time and further improve resistance to cold, we also added a Hash Plant from Pakistan. The result is a plant based on 70% sativa genes, with elegant, elongated buds. The loose structure of the buds means they’re very resistant to mould. Those who know it praise the versatility of this strain. It can be cultivated in a growing room as easily as it can outdoors. But remember: these plants can grow vigorously during the flowering phase, which can last up to ten weeks. In moderate or warm climates, plants regularly reach a height of two metres. Indoors, you can manage growth by keeping the vegetation period a little shorter. Thinning out the plants also helps, resulting in bushier growth. The side branches of the Mexican Sativa respond well to this method.Other cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Lollipopping or Supercropping are also suitable for this cannabis strain, and will further increase already good yields. Effect, flavour and smell of Mexican Sativa RegularThe powerful, energetic high is perfect for physical activities. The majority of smokers report feelings of euphoria accompanied by (uncontrollable) giggling fits. New cannabis users should proceed with caution. Because Mexican Sativa is not a pure sativa, it also has a relaxing component. It has a long-lasting effect. The flavours of Mexican Sativa are an unusual blend of sandalwood, flowery notes and pine. The scent during the growth and flowering phase is subtle, which is an advantage for certain growers. When smoked, notes of liquorice and citrus come to the fore, with underlying woody and earthy flavours. If you want a change from the usual Haze flavours, this could be the perfect strain for you!Did you know?“Sativa, sweet sativa, cannabis sativa, grown by nature down in Mexico,…” The heavy metal fans among you may recognise these lyrics. The hard guitar riffs by Anvil are a matter of taste, but the song “Sativa” goes well with the energy boost this strain triggers.In addition to these regular seeds, this cannabis strain is also available as Mexican Sativa Feminized.
