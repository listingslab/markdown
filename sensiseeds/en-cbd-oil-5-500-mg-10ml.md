CBD Oil 5% contains CBD extracted from EU-grown hemp, with additional certified organic hemp oil. It’s rich in high-quality cannabidiol, and its THC levels are less than 0.05%. Like most of our CBD products, it’s suitable for vegans. How is CBD Oil 5% produced?The first step is to harvest the hemp leaves, then allow them to dry for four hours. After this, the leaves are compressed into pellets, then the ingredients are taken out, via supercritical CO2 extraction.These ingredients are dehydrated and decarboxylated, which produces the CBD. This is combined with organic hempseed oil. There are several other substances in our CBD Oil. These include: cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabichromene (CBC), which are all phytocannabinoids. There are also terpenes in the oil, such as linalool, limonene, myrcene, phytol, humulene, alpha and beta-pinene, caryophyllene, and caryophyllene oxide. Lastly, several other natural substances are included, like amino acids and sugars, flavonoids, ketones, vitamins, nitrogenous compounds, alkanes, aldehydes, and pigments. The appearance and aroma of CBD Oil 5%This CBD Oil is 5% CBD (500 mg). It’s a moderate concentration, and we also offer a 2.75% and a 10% CBD Oil. The tincture is a distinctive green-brown colour, and sometimes has some sediment at the bottom. Rest assured, this is normal, and doesn’t affect the quality of the oil. The aroma is grassy and earthy, with strong notes of hemp. It’s an acquired taste – some people rate it highly, while others prefer dislike it. For those who don’t like the aroma, we also have a range of CBD capsules. In summary…5% CBD is available in two bottle sizes: 10 ml (500 mg) and 30 ml (1500 mg)The hemp oil that we use is certified organicIt’s suitable for vegansIt comes in a range of potencies: 2.75%, 5% and 10%
