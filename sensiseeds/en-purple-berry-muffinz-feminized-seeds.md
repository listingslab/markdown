This plant finishes flowering in up to 55 days, giving gardeners the opportunity for more growing cycles each year. A perfect-sized plant for growers with small tents or low ceilings. Amaze your friends with one of the freshest profiles at the party.Growth pattern of Purple Berry Muffinz FeminizedPurple Berry Muffinz Feminized has a genetic lineage that includes the Sensi Seeds Purple Bud, outcrossed with Blueberry Muffin and Zkittlez cultivars. It was created as part of our exclusive collaboration with Humboldt Seed Company, in the Breeding Grounds project. This combination created a cultivar with tremendous profiles and full effects. Although Purple Berry Muffinz Feminized is a 50% indica / 50% sativa hybrid, the growth pattern remains uniquely indica.Purple Berry Muffinz Feminized cannabis seeds grow into a highly compact plant with short internodal spacing. Lower limbs grow into sturdy branches that catch up quickly to the apical tip. Finished heights are generally within 80 to 100 cm indoors. Often, outdoor growers with an ideal climate can see finished heights approaching 100 cm or above.Purple Berry Muffinz seeds are available in the feminized format, which gives growers the advantage of not having to cull males. Purple Berry Muffinz Feminized has an amazingly fast flowering duration of 45 to 55 days. Indoor growers can increase the number of annual harvests with this quick finisher.Purple Berry Muffinz Feminized plants are capable of large yields in the ideal environment. Indoors, cultivators have achieved yields of 500 - 550 grams per mÂ². Outdoor growers in temperate / Continental climates have recorded harvests up to 600 grams per plant and sometimes beyond that. Training techniques like SCROG, SOG, Supercropping, and Lollipopping can all be used to increase output and support. The flowers are predominantly olive green, with purple hues that decorate the surrounding leaves and make their way onto the buds. Shrouding those lovely colours is a thick layer of sticky, resinous trichome heads full of cannabinoids and terpenes. Buds are dense and tend to cluster into larger colas at the tips of each branch.Effects, taste, and smell of Purple Berry Muffinz FeminizedPurple Berry Muffinz Feminized walks the line between indica and sativa, offering the best of both worlds regarding the effects.

This heightened sense of awareness transitions into a relaxing and soothing body high. Not debilitating, Purple Berry Muffinz Feminized is ideal for a daytime treat.The aroma of Purple Berry Muffinz Feminized is a deliciously sweet candy scent that is offset by the piercing fragrance of diesel. The contrast of the two creates a unique and bold perfume in the air. While growing, particularly in the final weeks of flowering, Purple Berry Muffinz Feminized emits a slightly pungent floral aroma tempered by a sweet and mellow scent.Compared to the scent, the flavour profile is slightly more complex. The taste is both sweet and pungent, but there is more. Specifically, dominant floral notes compliment the sweet and pungent as they sit over undertones of exotic sandalwood and creamy cookies.Did you know?
