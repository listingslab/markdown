White Skunk Automatic by White Label is the ideal option for anyone growing cannabis for the very first time. As an autoflowering strain, it requires minimum budget, minimum effort, and minimum gardening experience of any kind. Harvests are satisfying and swift. Along with Purple Bud Automatic, they’re White Label’s cheapest autoflowering strain. Growth pattern of White Skunk Automatic by White LabelLike the Regular and Feminized variants, White Skunk Automatic by White Label is 35% sativa and 65% indica. However, since it’s autoflowering, it thrives well outdoors in cold climates. This makes it an appealing choice for those living in countries with shorter, colder summers. White Skunk Auto’s growth structure is similar to the original, with a strong central stem and stubby lateral branches. Expect to see densely packed nodes, and relatively open buds. It’s a compact strain, which means it’s ideal for smaller gardens or growrooms with limited ceiling space. If growing in a pot, many experts advise transferring the small seedlings to larger containers. This is because White Skunk Automatic cannabis seeds are surprisingly fast-growing, which can catch gardeners by surprise. Large pots or free soil are both ideal, enabling the plant to reach its full potential size and yield. Although satisfying, the harvest may be less plentiful than the Regular and Feminized versions of this strain. This is typical of autoflowering cannabis plants. Novice growers (or those living in cold climates) accept this as a trade-off for the robust, easy-to-grow nature of the plants. More experienced growers living in warmer areas, or with indoor setups, might want to consider White Skunk Regular or White Skunk Feminized instead. Effect, taste, and smell of White Skunk Automatic by White LabelThis strain closely resembles the Regular and Feminized versions, in that it produces a distinctive citrus aroma, which some describe as being like bitter orange. This combines pleasantly with the earthy, skunky base-notes. The scent isn’t very strong during the cultivation stages, but becomes noticeably more potent after harvesting and curing. The buds are dominated by the smell of citrus, along with a hint of chocolate. These flavours are also detectable after consumption. As for the effect of White Skunk Auto? It’s less intense than other strains, which is ideal for those looking for cannabis that can be consumed in the morning or during the day. It’s also suitable for those who aren’t used to consuming it regularly. The indica genetics mean that this strain makes the user feel relaxed, while the sativa element stimulates and uplifts. This highly enjoyable combination is a hallmark of the skunk family, and is great for social or solo consumption. Did you know?
