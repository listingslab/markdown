White Haze Automatic by White Label is the Haze strain for everyone: affordable, easy to grow and ready to harvest in no time. This is a hybrid with 50% sativa and 50% indica genes.White Haze Automatic by White Label growth patternHaze strains are notoriously difficult to grow. Logical, really, when you think that they originate from tropical countries such as Thailand and Mexico. As pure sativas, they grew to over 3 m high, and had a long flowering stage. Crossing them with indicas has reduced the height gain, and increased the yield at the same time. They are now fit for climate zones outside the tropics, as it were. White Haze Automatic cannabis seeds by White Label mark the current high point of this development. These seeds will give even growers without green fingers robust cannabis plants that reach a maximum height of 140 cm, and which can be harvested 12 to 16 weeks after sowing Just three months for the entire life cycle? Yes! Thanks to the Sensi Seeds breeders who paired a White Haze with a Cannabis Ruderalis. The result is a hybrid comprising half sativa and half indica genes. Following a short vegetation phase, these plants automatically move into the flowering phase. In other words, growers have no need to adjust the lighting period. Here’s another benefit of this strain: because these are feminised seeds, there’s no need to weed out the male shoots at the start of flowering. Why complicate things when it’s so easy? Effect, flavour and smell of White Haze Automatic by White LabelThe plants exude their captivating, sharp and sweet scent towards the end of the flowering period. The buds should be sticky at this stage. That is because of the white glands (trichomes) from which this strain derives its name. They can be collected with a dry sieve, and then pressed into hashish. And smoked as weed, White Haze Auto by White Label also delivers the euphoric high characteristic of Haze strains. Fits of the giggles are also the order of the day. Thanks to the indica gene, the uplifting high is followed by a relaxing, physical stone feeling.The taste is dominated by earthy pine tones which, depending on the phenotype, may be accompanied by citrus notes.Did you know?Haze and music go together like yin and yang. And not just in the hip-hop scene, which is especially open to ganja.Incidentally, this cannabis strain is also available as White Haze Regular by White Label. It won 1st prize at the Cannabis Cup 2002.
