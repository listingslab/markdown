The Kush family has become an essential element of cannabis breeding in the US. Kush mixed with other cultivars has created many of the most popular contemporary cannabis strains. Double Kush Cake contains all the best traits of our many Kush cultivars, and is the Sensi Seeds tribute to our Kush dynasty. The sweet, dank flavours and relaxing effects bring the US Kush experience home.This strain is 70% indica, 10% sativa, and 20% ruderalis. It’s a feminized autoflowering variant, which makes it easy to cultivate, even for beginners. Its impressive genetic pool includes Hindu Kush Auto, Skunk Kush, and Afghani #1, and it produces an effect that’s pleasantly relaxing, with a real indica buzz. The scent is pleasantly earthy, sweet and skunky, and the plants can be grown discreetly, thanks to their compact size. Growth pattern of Double Kush Cake Automatic This hybrid strain has a prodigious parentage, with a genetic pool that includes Afghani #1, Skunk Kush, and Hindu Kush Automatic. The ruderalis influence ensures that the plants are hardy, and can be grown in a variety of climates, and the indica-dominance is evident in the scent and the high. It’s a 70% indica, 10% sativa and 20% ruderalis strain, and is feminized and autoflowering. This means that the seeds produce plants which will grow and flower as though they are female, and will begin flowering automatically. This gives the advantages that the flowering times are predictable, and there is no need to change the lighting cycles if growing indoors. As such, it’s a good choice for those with limited cultivation experience. Thanks to the ruderalis genes, the strain has a short flowering time of just 7 to 9 weeks (49 to 63 days). This is very swift, enabling growers to enjoy a harvest without waiting too long. The indica parentage ensures that the plants remain compact, even at full height. This makes them suitable for discreet growing, both indoors and out. Like many indica-dominant strains, the plants are short, sturdy and bushy, with a thick central cola. The buds are usually big and dense, and coated in a layer of resin. Although this is an auto strain, the harvests are still fairly sizeable. Growers have reported generating around 350-450 grams/m2. The plants are also hardy, and thrive in even cooler, more temperate climates. Alternatively, they can be cultivated indoors all year round. More experienced growers may want to experiment with the SOG (Sea of Green) or lollipopping techniques to boost the yield further.
