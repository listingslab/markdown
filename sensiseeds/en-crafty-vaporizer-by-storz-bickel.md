The result is hours of pleasurable vaping and remarkable value for money.Even craftier than the Crafty, the Crafty is the essential companion for the on-the-go cannabis user. Created by Storz & Bickel, it features the ergonomic design and solid construction you’d expect from the pioneers of premium cannabis vaping equipment. The Crafty produces amounts of vapour comparable with tabletop vaporizers, despite being small enough to fit in a small handbag, purse, or pocket.
