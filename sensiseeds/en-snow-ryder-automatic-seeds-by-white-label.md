Snow Ryder Automatic by White Label takes its name from the spectacular icy resin that forms over the plentiful buds. It’s easy to grow indoors, and compact enough even for those without much available space. It’s 75% indica, and this is evident in the high, which is a total-body stone. However, there’s a hint of sativa uplift too. The scent is pleasantly earthy and spicy, with a touch of sweet citrus. Growth pattern of Snow Ryder AutomaticSnow Ryder Automatic by White Label cannabis seeds are 75% indica, with sativa and ruderalis genetics incorporated into the mix. This results in a strain that’s compact and easy to cultivate, while offering a deep, intense all-body stone.This is an autoflowering variant, which means that flowering starts at a predetermined time, regardless of light cycles. This makes it much easier to cultivate, as there’s no uncertainty about when the plants will enter their flowering period. As for the flowering stage? It usually lasts about 55-65 days, which is slightly longer than other autoflowering varieties. However, the vegetation stage is short, which means the total life cycle isn’t too protracted. As with many indica-dominant strains, Snow Ryder Auto is relatively compact. Usually, the plants don’t tend to exceed 120 cm in height, regardless of whether they’re grown indoors or outside. They can be kept even shorter inside if required; with some growers stating that they’ve successfully limited the plant’s growth to as short as 40 cm. However, it’s important to note that it’s not a dwarf cannabis strain. White Label Snow Ryder plants are robust and slightly squat in appearance, which is usual with indica-dominant varieties. The internodes are close together, and the flowers have a uniquely icy, crystallised appearance. This is often white, but sometimes almost amber-coloured.For an autoflowering strain, Snow Ryder delivers pretty good yields. When grown indoors, it’s not unusual for the plants for produce around 450 grams per square metre. Outside, the results are less plentiful, but growers can still get around 200 grams per plant, if harvesting takes place before the start of September. The plants thrive in the sunny summer months, but as a sturdy auto strain, it can survive in more temperate climates too. It can be grown inside all year round. Effect, taste, and smell of Snow Ryder AutomaticWhite Label’s Snow Ryder Automatic is 75% indica, and the strong indica genetics are immediately obvious upon consumption. Despite being an auto, the strain is capable of producing a fairly potent stone, which is relaxing and soothing. Users report that it results in a sense of calm and wellbeing, both in body and mind. However, there’s also a hint of lift, which comes from the sativa influence. While growing, the plants produce a sweet, citrus-tinted aroma, which has a hint of dank earthiness to it. Once the buds are harvested, this smell becomes stronger, and takes on a spicier tone. To taste, users usually notice the citrus coming through, along with the tangy flavour of earth. Did you know? Snow Ryder Automatic earned its name thanks to the icy, crystallised resin that forms on its buds. When grown outside, growers usually plant the seeds by April, in order to flower during the warmest months. Snow Ryder Automatic is a good choice for growers with limited space, as the plants seldom grow taller than 120 cm.
