Simply plant and watch it do its thing – that’s absolutely all this strain needs! Thanks to its unparalleled robust nature, our tall outdoor queen has won over growers’ hearts. Its indica heritage manifests itself in a deeply relaxing stone that can last several hours.Guerrillas Gusto Regular’s unusual journey began in northern Spain, where the strain was tested and refined over many years. One of our customers eventually brought only the best seeds to the Netherlands, where our breeders immediately got to work. The idea was to take various Sensi Seeds parent plants to enhance the originally pure Indian genetics. The aim: greater resilience, greater strength, greater yield - and all faster than before. It’s pretty logical that we used a skunk here; but Guerrillas Gusto Regular also incudes other, potentially surprising elements.
