White Label’s Pure Power Plant Feminized is ready to harvest in super-quick times, making it ideal for any grower who’s looking fast results. The dense, frosty buds provide a hint of the potent high, which is focused and energetic. This is thanks to the strain’s 60% sativa genetics. Expect to enjoy plentiful yields – as much as 700 grams per square metre when cultivated outdoors. Growth pattern of Pure Power Plant FeminizedWhite Label Pure Power Plant Feminized cannabis seeds are a potent hybrid; made up of 60% sativa and 40% indica. Its exact genetics have been kept a secret, though it’s known that the sativa parent plant is South African, and the indica originates from the US. The slight sativa dominance is evident in the high, which is energising and euphoric. This is a feminized strain, which means that it’s highly unlikely that any male plants will grow from the seeds. This means cultivation is much easier, making it a suitable option for novice growers. Pure Power Plant Feminized also has high resistance to mould, which is another advantage. Another benefit of this strain is the relatively quick flowering time, which is usually around 50 to 60 days. This means that, when grown indoors, it’s possible to enjoy multiple harvests each year. Outdoor growers usually harvest the buds around mid-September to mid-October. The plants usually reach an average height. It’s not uncommon for them to be around 100 to 140 cm when they’re fully grown, which is manageable for most people. Structurally, they take on a ‘pine tree’ shape, with short internodal gaps and a strong, thick stem. The yield is particularly impressive, surpassing many other cannabis strains. In the right conditions outdoors, Pure Power Plant Feminized can produce around 600 to 700 grams per square metre. Inside, expect to generate around 450 to 600 grams. The buds are highly distinctive: dense and heavy, and covered in sticky trichomes. This gives some clue as to how potent the effects of this strain are. Pure Power Plant Feminized is best suited to warm, sunny climates, such as the Mediterranean. The plants can also be grown in a greenhouse or indoors. They’re suitable for most growing techniques, and respond well to both the SCROG (Screen of Green) and SOG (Sea of Green) methods. Growers also report getting good results with lollipopping and supercropping.
