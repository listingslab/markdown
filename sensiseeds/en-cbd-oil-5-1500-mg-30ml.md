CBD Oil 5% is made from hemp grown in the EU, and is free from both herbicides and pesticides. It contains top-quality cannabidiol, plus many other natural substances. The THC levels are negligible (less than 0.05%). How is CBD Oil 5% produced?Firstly, the hemp leaves are harvested and dried for four hours. Then, they’re compressed into pellets, and the important ingredients are removed via a process known as supercritical CO2 extraction. In order to produce CBD, these ingredients need to be dehydrated and decarboxylated. They’re then combined with certified organic hempseed oil. There are many other substances present in our CBD Oil. It contains various phytocannabinoids, including cannabinol, cannabigerol, and cannabichromene. The oil also includes terpenes, such as myrcene, limonene, linalool, humulene, phytol, caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and alpha / beta-pinene. Other natural substances are incorporated too. These include sugars, amino acids, vitamins, ketones, nitrogenous compounds, alkanes, pigments, flavonoids, and aldehydes. The appearance and aroma of CBD Oil 5% This 30 ml CBD Oil contains 5% CBD (1500 mg in total). We also offer a 2.75% CBD Oil plus a 10% CBD Oil. The oil is greenish-brown in colour, and you can expect to see some sediment of plant material at the bottom of the bottle. This is normal, and isn’t an indication that anything is wrong with the product. The aroma is strong; earthy, with fresh, grassy notes. If it’s not to your taste, you may prefer our range of CBD capsules. Alternatively, you could opt for our CBD Oil Gold 5%, favoured by many due to the nutty aroma.
