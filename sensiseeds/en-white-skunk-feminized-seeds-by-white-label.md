White Skunk Feminized by White Label is a high yielding hybrid with a bright citrus aroma. Its balance of 35% sativa, 65% indica creates a long-lasting sensation of peaceful relaxation, enlivened by a cheerful high. Even novice gardeners can achieve satisfying harvests with minimum effort. Our White Skunk is an excellent option for skunk lovers on a budget, and anyone growing cannabis for the very first time. Growth pattern of White Skunk Feminized by White LabelWhite Label’s White Skunk Feminized, like the other expressions of this strain, is 65% indica. As a hybrid, it has the short flowering time, and compact size of most indica cannabis plants. However, the 35% sativa element is evident too, in the open bud structure, and reduced lateral branching. When grown in pots, the size is likely to be smaller. Growers looking for an even more compact plant can shorten the vegetation period. Despite their usual short stature, it is possible to make the plants achieve impressive heights. If grown in a warm or temperate climate in free soil, it’s not uncommon for them to reach as two metres. White Skunk Feminized is a reliably homogenous strain. This means it’s easy to grow and maintain, even for novice gardeners. The plants respond well to topping, which is useful for growers looking to encourage more branching. They’re also well-suited to lollipopping, and the Sea of Green (SOG) and Screen of Green (SCROG) techniques. Yields are usually impressive, which is another aspect that attracts growers. White Skunk Feminized can be cultivated indoors or outside. However, it doesn’t respond well to cooler, shorter summers. Those living in cold climates may prefer to select the Automatic version of this strain instead. Effect, taste, and smell of White Skunk Feminized by White Label The scent of White Skunk Feminized is sweeter than the typical skunk smell. It’s distinctly citrussy, and the fruity notes get stronger as the plants get closer to harvesting. Expect to detect hints of orange and pineapple, particularly after curing the buds.This citrus flavour carries through to consumption. White Skunk Feminized by White Label not only has a pleasant flavour, it also produces a mellow, laid-back effect, thanks to the indica genetics. The sativa adds stimulation, giving the user a cheerful lift. This makes it ideal for daytime use, as well as in the evening. Did you know?
