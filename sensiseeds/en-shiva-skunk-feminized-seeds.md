Shiva Skunk Feminized is one of our most powerful skunk strains. The lack of male plants means that it’s easy to cultivate, and its vigorous growth and resinous buds produce excellent yields. As for the high? Expect to feel deeply relaxed and contemplative, though the 15% sativa sometimes also induces a sense of energy and adventure!Growth pattern of Shiva Skunk FeminizedShiva Skunk Feminized cannabis seeds are 85% indica and 15% sativa, and are a hybrid of Northern Lights #5 and Skunk #1. Thanks to these potent genetics, it’s Sensi Seeds’ strongest skunk strain, and combines the multiple benefits of both parent plants; such as ease of growth and an intense, relaxing high. This is the feminized version of the Shiva Skunk strain, which means that there’s an extremely low chance of producing male plants. This ensures that cultivation is even simpler than before, making the seeds suitable for all growers – from novices to those with more experience. The plants have a relatively short flowering time of 45 to 55 days, which is useful for those who want to enjoy speedy results. Due to the strain’s mostly indica characteristics, they don’t grow to towering heights. Most reach a final height of around 110 to 120 cm, which means they can be cultivated discreetly in a garden or greenhouse. When grown outdoors, they’re usually ready to be harvested around mid-September.In appearance, Shiva Skunk Feminized is similar to Northern Lights #5. The plants have many branches, and although the flowers take a while to appear, when they do, the buds are dense, heavy and extremely resinous. The yield is sizeable too. When cultivated indoors, growers can anticipate around 400-450 g/m2 per plant. Outdoors, in the right conditions, this can reach as high as 600 – 850 g/m2. As the flowering period advances, Shiva Skunk Feminized’s buds swell significantly. That’s when you can expect to see the bulk of the resin production. Shiva Skunk Feminized flourishes in warm, continental climates. The plants also grow well in a greenhouse, or indoors at any time of the year. Experienced growers may want to use the SCROG (Screen of Green) or Sea of Green (SOG) techniques, as these tend to generate good results with this strain. Supercropping and lollipopping are also effective. Effect, taste, and smell of Shiva Skunk FeminizedShiva Skunk Feminized is 85% indica / 15% sativa, and this indica-dominance is very much in evidence in its taste, scent and effect. Like its parent-plants, Northern Lights #5 and Skunk #1, it produces a powerful high. Expect to experience intense relaxation, both in body and mind, along with a sense of serenity and thoughtfulness. Some claim that it produces a red-eyed, giggly effect too. While growing, Shiva Skunk Feminized produces a sweet, musky aroma, with a hint of citrus. This intensifies towards harvest time, and the resulting buds also feature this pleasantly skunky, citrus scent. In terms of taste, expect something that’s dense, thick and almost creamy on the tongue. Some also report notes of tropical wood and a rich earthiness. Did you know? Shiva Skunk (Regular) won 1st place for Outdoor Grow by The Urban Club (ES) at CANNAVAL.It also won 2nd place at BHO Copa de Asociaciones Canarias. It’s named after the Hindu deity Shiva. This is partly due to the fact that Shiva is often associated with cannabis, and partly because the strain is so powerful. Shiva Skunk is Sensi Seeds’ most potent skunk to date.Shiva Skunk Feminized comes in two other variant: Shiva Skunk Regular and Shiva Skunk Automatic.
