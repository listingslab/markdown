This hybrid strain takes its name from the thick layer of white trichomes. These contain a lot of THC. The compact plants offer high yield potential - another reason why White Widow is a mainstay of the Dutch coffee shop industry.White Widow Regular by White Label growth patternOnly a few other cannabis strains measure up against White Widow. As a potent, easy-to-grow hybrid (65% indica, 35% sativa), this cannabis strain has taken the word by storm. Even today, almost a quarter of a century after it first appeared on the scene, White Widow Regular by White Label is a must in every coffee shop. White Widow and Amsterdam go together like a lid on a saucepan.Based on genetics dating back thousands of years, White Widow Regular by White Label is delightfully easy to look after, and resistant to temperature fluctuations. Even newcomers growing cannabis for the first time can’t go wrong with these seeds. They grow into medium-sized plants that stand out visually wherever they are cultivated. Why is that? It’s because of the many white glands (trichomes) that protect the buds, and lend the plants an almost mystical aura. They are a joy to behold, and are packed with potential healing properties in the form of cannabinoids. Growers who sow the seeds early enough, and live in a warm climate, can grow White Widow Regular by White Label outdoors. Even better results can generally be achieved inside under artificial light. It takes around two months from flowering through to harvesting. It’s worth giving the plants enough time as this is the only way to allow the exceptional trichome production to be pushed to the maximum. Its compact structure makes this cannabis strain a perfect candidate for a SOG (Sea of Green), where many small plants sit closely next to each other. The rich yields can thus be even further increased. Half a kilo per square metre is absolutely possible! XXL yields are thus one of the main reasons why certain growers keep returning to White Widow Regular by White Label.

In terms of effect, White Widow Regular by White Label is among the crème de la crème of cannabis seeds.

When smoked, this weed tastes earthy, spicy and sweet, with a pine flavour typical of marijuana. The flavours are of course best experienced in a vaporizer. Depending on the phenotype, the basic notes are accompanied by fresh citrus flavours.Did you know?To make life even easier, you can also order these seeds as White Widow Feminized by White Label or White Widow Automatic by White Label.
