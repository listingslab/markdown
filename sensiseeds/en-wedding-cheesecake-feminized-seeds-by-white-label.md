Further up the Wedding Cheesecake family tree are OG Kush, Granddaddy Purple, and the West Coast’s Purple Urkel. There are also some all-time greats from Sensi Seeds - Hindu Kush, Big Bud, and – influencing both sides of the family – Durban, the potent South African sativa. Wedding Cheesecake feminized cannabis seeds by White Label display desirable traits from five generations of breeding. These include the complex flavour profile, unbelievable resin production, and huge buds on a sturdy, compact, fast-flowering frame. Growth pattern of Wedding Cheesecake Feminized by White LabelWedding Cheesecake feminized cannabis seeds are 70% indica, 30% sativa. They grow well in a greenhouse, or outdoors in a warm, sunny climate. However, indoors under lights is where the plants truly flourish. As a fast, low-maintenance strain, Wedding Cheesecake can be cultivated even by novice growers. The most important factors for this variety are bright light and low humidity, which maximise its flowering potential. Growers should also bear in mind that this strain can produce an increasing odour from the very onset of flowering, so a good air filter system is important.Pruning branches completely to allow close spacing (AKA lollipopping) is not advised. However, close spacing and good yield can be achieved by flowering small clones in the Sea of Green (SOG) method. Pruning/topping the main stems of larger plants may increase budding sites and overall yield. Wedding Cheesecake typically doubles in size as it flowers, with some plants adding 150% to their vegetated height. Rare examples may triple their height in the blooming phase.White Label Wedding Cheesecake flowers quickly and vigorously, forming massive, weighty colas on the upper half of its main stem and branches. Smaller, yet equally dense, resinous flower-clusters fill the lower nodes, leaving little unoccupied space on the plants’ compact frames. Calyxes are medium-sized, highly resinous orbs, with long pistils that sometimes turn pink, rather than orange, as they mature. The combination of large buds (made up of mid-sized calyxes with profuse trichomes) and long pistils give the main colas of Wedding Cheesecake a unique appearance - fuzzy and sparkling at the same time.Taste, smell and effect of Wedding Cheesecake Feminized by White LabelAfter harvest, dried buds remain large, solid, and sticky with resin. When broken up (or even handled vigorously), they fill the air with the awesome terpene profile inherited from Wedding Cheesecake’s pedigree lineage. The strongest element is inherited from Cheese – a fantastically pungent Skunk with strong, sweet berry overtones. This is accompanied by sharper citrus, plus earthy and woody notes from other illustrious forebears.It goes without saying that White Label Wedding Cheesecake has an extremely powerful effect, and should be handled with care even by more experienced smokers. On first encounter, it’s advisable to inhale one or two moderate test puffs, then wait a short while to see how strong the effects are. At any dose this strain’s high is typically warm, positive and uplifting. At medium to high doses, effects can range from heavy, contemplative, full-body relaxation, to sky-high, talkative, creative, and even psychedelic experiences.
