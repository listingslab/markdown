White Gold Regular by White Label produces strong, potent, and visually appealing plants. These regular seeds are also known for their resin production, rich harvests, and irresistibly sweet flavour.White Gold Regular by White Label growth patternIt’s never easy for the children of famous parents. They find themselves being constantly compared. The bar is set high if they want to achieve something for themselves. So it’s all the more impressive to see how commandingly White Gold Regular by White Label is moving through the cannabis world. The daughter of White Widow and Himalayan Gold is as popular with commercial growers as it is with users. Why is that? On the one hand it’s because of its accessibility and ease of cultivation – it’s certainly no prima donna. On the other hand, it reliably produces a large number of buds enclosed in a syrupy robe of resin. The white trichomes, together with the deep-green colour of the leaves and buds (that can appear purple in cooler temperatures), form a real feast for the eyes. The buds are long and furry with orange-coloured pistils. These plants are medium-high hybrids comprising 60% indica and 40% sativa. The flowering stage is comparatively short at 50 to 65 days. An indoor plant can easily yield half a kilo. In a warm climate with long summers, growers can also try their luck outdoors. An SOG (Sea of Green) or SCROG (Screen of Green) delivers particularly good results. Both these techniques work well both in indoor and outdoor cultivation. Many growers also optimise their crops with Topping, Suppercropping and Lollipopping. Effect, flavour and smell of White Gold Regular by White LabelThe effect of White Gold Regular by White Label is a combination of a calming stone feeling and a heady high. Experienced users delight in the high THC content. Sporadic cannabis users should not underestimate the potency of this strain. The basic rule is: you can always use more, but you can’t go back and use less. White Gold Regular by White Label promises both a mental and a taste high. The tropical and fruity flavour elevates it above other weed, and is underpinned by earthy tones and a delicate hint of Haze. If the discretion of marijuana that’s as inconspicuous as possible is important, this strain isn’t the best choice – it smells too strong for that. A good alternative with a similar cannabinoid profile is California Indica Regular.Did you know?For anyone who wants to make cultivation even easier: this cannabis strain is also available as White Gold Feminized by White Label.
