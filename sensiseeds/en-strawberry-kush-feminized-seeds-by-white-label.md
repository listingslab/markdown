Strawberry Kush Feminized by White Label is an indica-dominant strain with a sweet strawberry taste and scent. Its parent plants are Strawberry Cough, a legendary Californian strain, and OG Kush, a celebrated indica. The strain is capable of producing generous yields, especially the taller phenotypes.Growth pattern of Strawberry Kush Feminized by White LabelWhite Label’s Strawberry Kush Feminized is 70% indica, 30% sativa. Although it’s indica-dominant, it displays many desirable sativa characteristics.Grown from seed, phenotype variation is mostly expressed through small differences in height gain and flowering time. Bud formation remains consistent across different phenotypes. Indoor plants have a flowering time of seven to ten weeks and usually triple their vegetated height as they bloom. Experienced growers of White Label Strawberry Kush feminized cannabis seeds tend to select the taller, longer flowering phenotypes for their higher yields.Originally, Strawberry Kush was only available in clone form. Many indoor growers of this seed- strain achieve optimum results by flowering cuttings of selected mother plants.Plants grown from seed may simply be flowered as normal and will produce good results as long as the extra height gain is taken into account. This makes Strawberry Kush Feminized cannabis seeds a good choice for cultivation in a greenhouse, or outdoors in a warm, sunny climate, where their sativa-influenced height gain is an advantage.Indoors, Strawberry Kush clones are well suited to ScrOG/SOG and super-cropping techniques. Taller phenotypes are also good for lollipopping, as they’ll produce most of their yield on the upper half of each plant. Upper branches tend to grow at a steep angle and often merge with the central cola. As such, removing the more expansive, less productive lower branches enables Strawberry Kush plants to be grown closer together.In the flowering stage, Strawberry Kush shows off the best of its indica and sativa heritage. Calyxes quickly form at each node, then cover the internodal gaps. The flower clusters eventually join together, forming large colas on the main stem and at the top of the branches. This Haze-style expansion is fortified by the density and resin production of Afghan indica (aka Kush).The end result is long, sparkling solid buds which retain a good proportion of their size and weight after harvest. Discreet growers should note that this strain’s characteristic aroma is often present in the flowering stage.Taste, smell and effect of Strawberry Kush Feminized by White LabelThe pistils of some prized Strawberry Kush phenotypes start out pink, and change to a deep red as the flowers mature. This gives the dried buds an exotic appearance to match their spectacular aroma.When properly harvested and cured, their mouth-watering strawberry scent and flavour becomes much more powerful. To some connoisseurs, the smell of Strawberry Kush buds is almost intoxicating by itself.While that unique flavour profile is one of the most recognisable and appealing features of White Label Strawberry Kush, don’t forget that this is a highly potent strain. With excellent resin production inherited from both its Haze and Kush parents, Strawberry Kush imparts a powerfully relaxing indica body-buzz that’s elevated and extended by a happy sativa high.
