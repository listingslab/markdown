Super Skunk Regular by White Label provides generous crops of large, lime-green buds with powerful effects. Expect an uplifting high coupled with a deep sense of relaxation, ideal for dissolving tension. It’s easy to cultivate, even for beginners; growers with a little experience can achieve very large harvests. The scents and tastes are on the sweet side of the skunk family, with bright citrus top-notes. Growth pattern of Super Skunk Regular by White LabelWhite Label’s Super Skunk Regular is one of the earliest iterations of the original Skunk #1. It combines the original with a premium Afghan cultivar, which boosts yields and potency, and shortens the flowering period. The plants tend to flower for around seven weeks, producing substantial yields during this time. It’s an 80% indica, and this strong heritage is evident in the plant’s bushy form, sturdy stems and dense, chunky buds. Flowers usually develop around the nodes first, then more buds rapidly appear during flowering, until the internodal stems are concealed almost entirely. This strain can be grown outside, though it requires plenty of warmth and sunlight. Temperate or continental climates are ideal. Anticipate significant growth when planted in free soil, with lots of bulking and height. Harvests are also likely to be more impressive. Indoors, White Label Super Skunk Regular cannabis seeds produce plants that grow to an average height, and respond well to lollipopping techniques. The plants are also suitable for pinching out, topping, or fimming, which help create multiple central stems and colas. This is the case regardless of whether they’re planted inside, outside, or in a greenhouse. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk Regular by White LabelDuring the vegetative stage, Super Skunk Regular doesn’t produce a strong scent. However, once flowering is underway, the recognisable skunky aroma starts to become noticeable. This intensifies as time goes on, reaching a peak at the point of harvest. When consumed, the predominant flavours are warm earth and skunk, combined with top notes of pineapple and other tropical fruits. This is different to other skunk strains, which tend to produce garlicky, cheesy flavours. Super Skunk is 80% indica and 20% sativa, and both these influences are discernible after consumption. Users will experience a powerful sense of relaxation, alongside a sense of joy and merriment; a pleasant combination indeed. Did you know?
