Shiva Skunk Regular is our most potent skunk! We bred this for growers who aren’t afraid of powerful effects and pungent odours. Shiva Skunk is an award-winning variety that leaves a lasting impression of relaxation and delight on all who consume it. The plants are compact and sturdy, producing huge buds which, by the end of the short flowering period, are completely covered in resin. For those who love skunk, but wish it was stronger, this is an excellent choice. Growth pattern of Shiva Skunk RegularAlthough it was originally released over thirty years ago, Shiva Skunk remains a favourite among fans of cannabis. New generations of growers discover it every year, delighted by its ease of cultivation and large, chunky buds. Shiva Skunk Regular has the kind of bud structure and potency that only comes with a premium indica-dominant heritage. Being 85% indica ensures plentiful yields in a conveniently short flowering period of 45 to 55 days. Whether grown indoors or outside (in warm or temperate climates), growers can expect excellent harvests, without requiring too much technical know-how or expertise. Later in the flowering stage, the buds will rapidly bulk up. You’ll also notice the trademark layer of large trichomes (inherited from Northern Lights #5). The hybrid vigour means that Shiva Skunk Regular can outperform both of its parents in terms of resin content and yield. Shiva Skunk Regular is a compact strain, and the plants don’t grow to great heights. The lateral branching and squat, ‘pine tree’ shape means that it’s not well suited to lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Shiva Skunk RegularSome refer to Shiva Skunk’s scent as oily or dense, while others claim that it has a creamy quality. Either way, most people agree that the aroma is musky, with sweet citrus undertones. The smell of berry and sandalwood is also detectable. The plants produce a pungent scent - a fact that discreet growers might want to bear in mind. Shiva Skunk Regular produces potent effects, often lifting the mood, and making the user feel more adventurous or thoughtful. Some users say that it’s a smooth, mellow high, which is unsurprising, given that it was bred from two indica-dominant strains. However, the slightly euphoric effects are down to the plant’s sativa relatives. After sampling Shiva Skunk, expect to experience relaxing effects, minus the lethargy. This makes it a popular choice for consuming in the evening, or for those who want a calming effect without feeling tired. Please note, Shiva Skunk is known for producing powerful highs, so inexperienced users should proceed with caution! Did you know?
