Compact, fast-flowering and dense buds with plenty of THC and CBD: Master Kush Regular by White Label is a classical indica plant that smells of black hashish (charas).Master Kush Regular by White Label growth patternHigh above the rooftops of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan is a mountains range of raw beauty. The Hindu Kush is home to the wold’s finest indica cannabis strains. Our breeders used two of them, originating from India and Afghanistan, to create Master Kush. The compact, fast-flowering and heavy buds leave no doubt that this is a true indica (95%).The astonishing resin content of these plants explains why they are often referred to as hash plants. They provide the material for the world-famous black hash varieties that are hand-rolled into a ball on the Indian subcontinent and provided as ‘charas’. Dried buds from Master Kush Regular by White Label can of course also be smoked or vaped directly. No special expertise is needed to grow Master Kush. A few pots, water, soil and light are all that’s needed. Some fertiliser yields even better results; Master Kush can get quite hungry. Typically of an indica, flowering begins relatively early, and lasts for 50 to 55 days. During this time, the plants remain nicely compact, enabling them to be grown in rooms with low ceilings. They can also be grown outdoors in a mild climate.Master Kush Regular by White Label produces plentiful, resinous buds that retain their size and weight even after drying. We regularly receive reports from customers who have been delighted with rich harvests. If good isn’t good enough, harvests can be further maximised with a Sea of Green (SOG). Trimming techniques such as Supercropping and Lollipopping are suitable for this cannabis strain.Effect, flavour and smell of Master Kush Regular by White LabelIf there was an award for the best after-work weed, Master Kush would be right up there. Even inhaling just a couple of times leaves every muscle fibre feeling relaxed. While the body becomes pleasantly heavy, the mind remains relatively clear. Aficionados will immediately recognise the specific smell of dark charas. It is a mix of subtle, earthy tones with sandalwood and a hint of citrus. Did you know?In 2004, Master Kush was awarded at the High Life Cannabis Cup in Utrecht in the Netherlands.In addition to these regular seeds, we also sell Master Kush Feminized by White Label. For something even simpler, we recommend Master Kush Automatic by White Label.
