An excellent choice for novices who don’t want to miss out on a powerful high. With its characteristic citrus flavour, this strain surprises even regular Skunk users who delight in the short flowering time and rich yields.Sensi Skunk Regular growth patternSensi Skunk Regular, an indica-dominant cannabis strain, has been generating huge excitement on the scene since it was first introduced. This strain was possible due to the fact that the Sensi Seeds cannabis seed bank has been considered world-class since the early nineties. How did we manage it? By crossing a Skunk #1 with a secret, exceptionally sweet mother plant. Compared to Skunk #1, the calyxes are larger while the pistils are shorter. Plants grown from Sensi Skunk Regular cannabis seeds are characterised by their fast growth and short flowering time. They have average height gain. It’s one of those strain where even novices can’t go wrong. Enjoy a rich yield with little effort – that’s the promise of this cannabis strain!In moderate climates, Sensi Skunk Regular can be grown outdoors. Of course, it also flourishes magnificently under lamps or in a greenhouse. The best results can be achieved with a Sea of Green (SOG).Effect, flavour and smell of Sensi Skunk RegularThe thick buds of this indica-heavy hybrid leave no doubt: Sensi Skunk Regular is potent enough to bring a smile to the face of even hardened weed smokers. The calm yet euphoric high delivers a deeply relaxed effect. Tired muscles make a quick recovery. Very few users report severe hunger attacks - the munchies. European Skunk variants are praised for having a sweeter, less sharp flavour than their North American counterparts. We wanted to build on these attributes; our breeders have successfully captured the sugary citrus scent that makes a refreshing change from ordinary “Skunk Funk”. The result is a sweet, citrus flavour with an earthy and dry undertone.Did you know?Sensi Skunk and its relatives have won three awards at the Copa de la Marihuana. In 2006, this cannabis strain took the top prize. Sensi Skunk Regular is a low-maintenance strain; for an even easier cultivation process, choose Sensi Skunk Feminized or Sensi Skunk Automatic.
