SENSI #32 FEM combines one of the most exciting OG cannabis varieties to come out of the US in recent years, Fire OG, and one of our favourite cup-winning sativas, Silver Haze. In this cross, we chose to amplify the sativa qualities even more while preserving the strength and flavours from the Fire OG. The result is a powerful hybrid producing a copious amount of resinous buds.SENSI #32 FEM has been known to stretch 200% during its flowering period; indoors, is able to grow to 150 cm. Outdoors in a sunny, Mediterranean climate, it can easily reach 200 cm. This height gain coupled with the long flowering period results in excitingly heavy yields. The taste and aroma are a mouth-watering blend of citrus, spice and the earthy undertones from the Fire OG’s Kush lineage. This one is already a Sensi Seeds Research team favourite!
