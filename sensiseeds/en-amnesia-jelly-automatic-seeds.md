Amnesia Jelly Automatic is an ideal 80% sativa strain for those looking to increase creativity and productivity. Zesty citrus profiles linger in the air and sit heavy on the tongue with this Haze-like combination of genetics. Faster flowering than a traditional Haze, this strain is much more manageable in the grow room. Amnesia Jelly Automatic can be grown indoors or outdoors, and it is a good choice for new growers.Growth pattern of Amnesia Jelly AutomaticAmnesia Jelly Automatic cannabis seeds are developed as part of the Breeding Grounds project in collaboration with Humboldt Seed Company. They’re the product of mixing our Sensi Amnesia XXL Automatic with the Mint Jelly Automatic. The combination produces a sativa-dominant plant that expresses both sides of its lineage. The ruderalis influence keeps the plant compact, but the sativa side shows itself in the increased space between nodes. Minimal foliage makes trimming a piece of cake and reduces the need for defoliation.Like our other automatic strains, Amnesia Jelly Automatic is feminized, leaving growers with a garden full of flower-producing plants. Sativa genetics extend the flowering time slightly, with peak ripeness typically 85 to 95 days after planting. During this time, Amnesia Jelly Auto grows to a finished height of 70-110 cm indoors under ideal conditions. Outdoors, heights can reach upwards of 80-120 cm in temperate / Continental climates.The chunky, dense, light green buds of Amnesia Jelly Automatic form tight clusters at the tips of each branch. A heavy coating of terpene and cannabinoid-filled trichomes blanket the finished flowers. In ideal conditions, indoor gardeners harvest 250-300 grams per m². In the proper outdoor climate zone, growers pull down harvests near 160-200 grams per plant. Because of the compact stature, plant training techniques like SCROG, SOG, Supercropping, and Lollipopping are unnecessary.Effects, taste, and smell of Amnesia Jelly AutomaticThe effects from Amnesia Jelly Automatic represent the finer aspects of sativa-dominant genetics. Immediately the effects are active within the body, starting at the tip of the head. A warm fuzziness tickles the brain, stimulating the cerebral and euphoric effects. This strain is reported to increase creativity and productivity for many people.The dried and cured flowers of Amnesia Jelly Automatic have an overpowering sweetness. Zesty citrus notes compliment the overall sweetness, giving this strain an aroma that classic Haze connoisseurs would instantly recognise. While growing, there is a faint odour of funky floral notes, which grows more potent in the final weeks of flowering.The flavour profile of Amnesia Jelly Automatic offers some specificity to the zesty citrus profile. The taste is similar to the terpene profile, but there is a distinguishable essence of freshly picked mandarins in the flavour profile. Adding to the sweetness while slightly reducing the bite from the citrus influence are a combination of tropical fruit flavours.Did you know? Easy to grow choice for beginners.Amnesia Jelly is disease and mould resistant.Low maintenance, requires little to no pruning.
