Holland’s Hope Regular by White Label is 90% indica. This comes through in the high, which is intensely relaxing, both for the body and mind. The plants’ height can be limited indoors (good for those without much space). Outside, they can reach heights of 200 cm. This hardy strain can cope in even colder climates, and is resistant to mold. The smell is immediately recognisable; a deep, pungent skunk aroma that creates a welcome sense of nostalgia. Growth pattern of Holland’s Hope RegularHolland’s Hope Regular by White Label cannabis seeds are 90% indica and 10% sativa. The strain is one of the first in the world to be developed specifically to thrive in colder conditions. This explains the name, as The Netherlands’ climate is typically far cooler than other locations around the globe. This is the regular version of the strain, which means that the seeds will produce both male and female plants. The advantage of this is that growers will be able to generate their own collection of seeds, which can either be used for future grows, or for cross-breeding with other varieties. Holland’s Hope Regular has a fairly swift flowering period of 50 to 60 days; which is beneficial for those that want to obtain a harvest quickly. As with many indica-dominant strains, the plants are usually short, particularly when cultivated inside. Indoors, they reach heights of around 90 to 150 cm, and outside, their height tends to be 200 cm at the most.The plants are also very indica in appearance too, with plenty of bushy leaves, lots of branches, and an overall look of sturdiness. The buds are dense and heavy, and in some instances, can reach lengths of 50 cm. It’s possible to get a good harvest from the plants, without too much hard work. When grown inside, average yields are about 300 grams per square metre, and outdoors, they’re approximately 500 grams per plant. Holland’s Hope Regular has the distinct advantage of being well suited to cooler growing conditions. This makes it a favourite of growers in colder countries. The plants also benefit from lollipopping or supercropping.
