How are 20 mg CBD Capsules produced?CBD Capsules (20 mg each, 1200 mg in total) use cannabidiol that’s extracted from EU-grown hemp. The process starts with harvesting the hemp leaves and drying them for four hours. They’re then pressed into pellets, and the ingredients are extracted, using the supercritical CO2 process.These ingredients are dehydrated and decarboxylated to activate the CBD. Several other substances are included in the capsules, like these additional phytocannabinoids: cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN), and cannabichromene (CBC). Terpenes can also be found in the capsules: limonene, myrcene, nerolidol, linalool, alpha and beta-pinene, B-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, phytol, and humulene.
