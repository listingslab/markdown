The autoflowering version of Master Kush is highly resinous, ready to harvest in no time, and easy to grow. This strain is absolutely predestined for producing hashish, with a smell reminiscent of black finger hashish (charas) from India. Master Kush Automatic by White Label growth patternMaster Kush is one of the first cannabis strains created from two Kush strains. ‘Kush’ refers to the Hindu Kush mountains that extend from Afghanistan, across Pakistan and as far as India. It is the birthplace of cannabis indica, the branch of the cannabis family that’s known for its fast-flowering, dense buds and its resinous branches. Many indica varieties flourish even in mountainous regions and in extreme weather conditions. The considerable resin content of certain indica plants is why they are known as hashish plants – they are the source of the black finger hashish (charas) that is available across the entire Indian subcontinent. Master Kush Auto continues this heritage in a robust, compact seed strain. The plants begin to flower automatically after five to six weeks. Mature buds form in the finest indica fashion: they are dense, compact and heavy. They retain their size and weight after drying. Because this is a feminized strain that produces only female plants, there is no need to remove male shoots. The total cultivation period is short at an average of three months. Given good soil, and enough light and water, the seedlings flourish magnificently. Master Kush Automatic seeds enable even novices to grow premium-quality cannabis.Master Kush Automatic by White Label produces the majority of its yield from the main stem and the upper branches. Some growers trim the lower branches to intensify this effect. A Sea of Green (SOG) set-up is also suitable for this strain.Effect, flavour and smell of Master Kush Automatic by White LabelThe resinous buds contain high levels of THC and CBD, which on the one hand delivers a strong buzz, and on the other hand ensures a calm frame of mind. Anyone who’s been to India will recognise the smell of Master Kush immediately. Earthy, spicy and sweet – that pretty much describes the flavour. Overall, this strain tastes more intensive than it smells, which some growers value for reasons of discretion. Did you know?You can have high expectations of the winner of the High Life Cannabis Cup. In addition to these autoflowering seeds, Master Kush is also available as Master Kush Regular by White Label and Master Kush Feminized by White Label.
