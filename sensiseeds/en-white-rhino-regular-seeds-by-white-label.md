White Rhino Regular by White Label delivers just what’s wanted: an earthquake-like body stone coupled with XXL yields. No wonder when you think that this is a further development of White Widow. Ready for the next generation?Just as Super Skunk carried on the Skunk #1 success story, White Rhino Regular by White Label is heading for new shores. The aim was clear from the outset: to increase the resin production of White Widow without compromising on the potency. And that was possible thanks to a hand-picked Afghanica. The end result is that White Rhino Regular by White Label is a mix of three super-stable landraces from Brazil, South India and Afghanistan. White Rhino Regular by White Label growth patternAs might be expected from a strain with 90% indica, the plants remain very compact during the flowering phase. They have only an average height gain, and flower quickly; indoors after around 45 to 60 days, and outdoors at the end of October. You can expect densely packed buds with white and orange pistils. Because White Rhino Regular by White Label is an exceptionally resinous strain, the dried buds are suitable for the production of concentrates such as hash oil, wax or shatter. Growers who have mastered the entire art of cannabis cultivation can obtain a yield of up to 800 g from a single plant. As well as perfectly fertilised soil, this also requires well-regulated watering and lighting. This cannabis strain flourishes magnificently in a growing room or greenhouse. Outdoor cultivation should be considered only in a warm, sunny climate.Whether Screen of Green (SCROG), Sea of Green (SOG) or Lollipopping: special growing and pruning techniques sit in perfect harmony with White Rhino Regular by White Label. Effect, flavour and smell of White Rhino Regular by White LabelGrown and dried correctly, the buds from this marijuana strain contain a lot of trichomes (glands). Not only does this make them look stunning, it also means they are highly potent. It’s the high THC count, up to 20%, that delivers the powerful high. The cannabinoid profile is complemented with CBD and CBN. Many users experience the effect of White Rhino as pleasant, relaxing and soporific. But as with all THC-rich strains, caution is urged for users with no tolerance. Flavour-wise, this strain is a spicy combination of earthy and woody aromas accompanied by a sweet undertone.Did you know?The mother plant of White Rhino, White Widow, is one of the best-known cannabis strains in the world. It laid the foundation for an entire series of White strains. But beware: not everything that’s called White contains White. It’s worth critically examining seed banks and buying only from a trusted vendor.
