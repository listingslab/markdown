This popular strain is indica-dominant, which can be seen in its compact, stocky shape, and experienced in its soothing effects. The precise parentage of OG Kush is unknown, though most experts agree it’s a cross between Lemon Thai, Chemdawg and a Pakistani Kush. Likewise, no-one is sure where the name originates from; it’s commonly accepted that ‘OG’ stands for either ‘Ocean Grown’ or ‘Original Grower’, although it’s become a popular acronym for ‘Original Gangster’. This automatic variant is easy to cultivate, and grows well in temperate or continental climates. Growth pattern of OG Kush Automatic by White LabelOG Kush Automatic by White Label cannabis seeds are 75% indica, 25% sativa. It has stellar genetics, making it sought-after by those looking for the best of the new Kush family.The mostly indica genetics are clearly demonstrated as the plants mature; they’re compact, bushy and stocky. Likewise, the effects are classically indica – a soothing, mellow stone, with a hint of sativa uplift. This is the autoflowering expression of OG Kush, which is a good option for novice growers as cultivation is very straightforward. The flowering time is 70 to 80 days – relatively long for an automatic, but well worth the wait. The plants seldom reach towering heights, so it’s easy to discreetly cultivate them outside. As a general rule, growers can expect their crops to be anything from 80 to 180 cm tall, depending on whether they’re grown indoors, or outside in free soil. Their appearance is bushy and multi-branched, with lots of fan leaves. For an automatic, OG Kush’s yield is relatively generous. Indoors, growers can generate as much as 400 to 450 g/m2, while outdoors, typical harvests are around 50 to 170 g per plant. The buds are pleasing to behold – large, weighty, and covered in glistening resin, with a distinctive lime-green colour. To get the best results from this strain, grow indoors under lights, or outside in a temperate or continental climate. Effect, taste, and smell of OG Kush Automatic by White LabelOG Kush Automatic is an indica-dominant strain, and its effects are mostly indica in nature: a full-body, soothing stone that stops just short of leaving consumers unable to move. However, the 25% sativa genetics come through in the initial euphoric rush, and in the citrussy scent of the plants as they’re growing. The aroma contains spicy, lemony notes (characteristic of a sativa), though the typically dank aroma of earth and musk is also detectable, which is pure indica. The smell becomes more potent as the plants mature, something growers need to be aware of if they’re trying to cultivate without attracting attention. The taste of OG Kush is similarly lemony, with additional hints of petroleum and pepper. Did you know? OG Kush Automatic is also available as OG Kush FeminizedIt’s believed that the strain originally came from North CaliforniaThe OG in the name is thought to stand for ‘Ocean Grown’, though there is debate about thisOG Kush is simple to grow, and thrives in temperate and continental climates
