Jack Herer® Feminized is a THC-rich hybrid strain (50% sativa, 50% indica) for indoor cultivation. There are several phenotypes with different growth characteristics. The lasting effect is felt in both the mind and the body. Jack Herer® Feminized growth patternThe majority of phenotypes show distinct sativa growth behaviour, coupled with resin production and the lush flowering of an indica. Growers should be aware that these plants grow vigorously during the flowering stage. However, there is a more rare indica-dominated phenotype which does not spread as far and is altogether more compact. You’ve got to see the buds from this strain: they are some of the biggest in existence. With sativa phenotypes, resin-covered calyxes form at several points, lending the plants a wild appearance. Talking of resin: carefully cultivated buds glisten with a thick layer of THC-rich trichomes. Because this diamond-dusted appearance is maintained in the dried buds, they are extremely popular with sellers and smokers. If you examine a bud under the microscope, you will see that it is composed more from resin glands than from plant tissue. Depending on the phenotype, Jack Herer® Feminized is ready to harvest in around 10 to 12 weeks. Plants with a strong indica dominance can be harvested after just 8 weeks. Remember that this cannabis strain was developed for indoor cultivation. Outdoor cultivation will succeed only in a warm climate with plenty of sunshine. In the right hands, Jack Herer® Feminized cannabis seeds produce a lush yield which can be further increased with specific techniques such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Supercropping and Lollipopping.Effect, flavour and smell of Jack Herer® FeminizedAs varied as the growth behaviour may be, in terms of effect, Jack Herer® is incredibly constant. The high-energy cerebral high is underlaid by a breathtaking body buzz. So don’t be surprised to feel the earth shake beneath your feet as your mind soars into the stratosphere. If you like weed with a high CBD content and few psychoactive effects, you should look to a different strain.When grown indoors, plants of this strain produce only a subtle scent, making them a great choice for discreet stealth growers. It is not until they are dried that they develop their wonderful aromatic bouquet. The majority of buds have a complex, sharp and savoury hashish tone which, depending on the phenotype, is blended with Afghan tones and fruity skunk flavours.Did you know?Jack Herer® has won just about every award going. The original strain has dominated harvest festivals across the world for years. But Jack wouldnt be Jack without taking it a step further. Jack Herer® Regular has been included in the official cannabis programme of the Netherlands as a prime example of a strain with a high THC content.Jack Herer® Regular and the attractively priced variant White Label Jack Herer® Regular are also available from Sensi Seeds.
