The Many Incredible Benefits of Hemp Superfood For hundreds of years, hemp seed oil has been extracted from hemp seeds and used worldwide for its health benefits. Hemp seeds are nutritious for many reasons, but most striking are the high-quality fats they produce when cold-pressed as oil. A wealth of phytonutrients, healthy fats and antioxidants will boost your health in a wide variety of ways. From hormonal balance to anti-aging and skin protection. Soothes skin: The vitamin E contained in hemp oil helps reduce inflammation and dryness, which is great for soothing skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis and other rashes. Shinier hair: Ingesting hemp seed oil or using a weekly oil mask can greatly improve the moisture quality of hair. Which means shinier, healthier locks. Eases Arthritis pain: The immune modulating effects of essential fatty acids combined with the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin E and Omega 3, may help improve the symptoms of arthritis. Aging antioxidants: If you’re hoping to age gracefully, antioxidants are key. Over time, the body accumulates damage from environmental free radicals. Consuming foods high in antioxidants neutralises free radicals, therefore protecting cells from damage. Balances hormones: Studies have shown that gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is useful in helping to balance hormones. For women, GLA can ease premenstrual syndrome and reduce pain during menstruation. Boosts immunity: Hemp is nutritious for many reasons, but most striking is the high-quality fats that cold-pressed oil provides. Fatty acids are essential for modulating the immune system. Healthy heart & nervous system: It’s no surprise that essential fatty acids help promote a healthier heart. GLA can lower bad cholesterol and prevent saturated fat buildup in the arteries. Essential fatty acids are crucial for the nervous system too. All Sensi Seeds Hemp Foods products are completely additive-free and natural.
