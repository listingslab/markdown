Outdoor Mix Regular is the perfect option for growers who want to test out several different varieties of indica-dominant cannabis at once. Each pack features a random mix of Guerilla’s Gusto, Ruderalis Indica, Early Girl, Early Skunk, and Ruderalis Skunk. They’ll produce regular plants, which is useful for future grows, or experimental cross-breeding. Although the plants are different strains, all of them offer a typical indica scent; skunky and pungent. The high is classic indica too; calming and sedative. Growth pattern of Outdoor Mix RegularOutdoor Mix Regular cannabis seeds are a random mix of five different indica-dominant varieties. These are: Early Skunk, Early Girl, Ruderalis Indica, Ruderalis Skunk, and Guerrilla’s Gusto. The subtle variations between the strains gives first-time growers the opportunity to learn how to identify them.The seeds are all regular, which means they’ll produce a mix of male and female plants. This is appealing for the more experienced grower, who may want to experiment with cross-breeding the strains in the future. It also means that seeds can be generated for future grows. As this pack features five different strains, the flowering times vary slightly from plant to plant. However, as they’re all indica, the flowering periods are relatively short. This is useful for those who want to get results in a hurry. The first plants to start producing buds will be the naturally autoflowering varieties; Ruderalis Indica first, followed by Ruderalis Skunk. Then the other strains will start to flower. Early Girl is ready for harvest fairly speedily, closely followed by Guerrilla’s Gusto. The last to harvest is Early Skunk. Outdoor Mix Regular’s plants all grow to different heights. Usually, they’re more compact when grown indoors under artificial light, and none of the plants tend to reach excessive heights when planted outside. They’re all quite diverse in appearance, but share some of the same indica characteristics; such as multiple branches and an overall look of bushiness and sturdiness. Yields tend to be good with these strains too, though the autoflowering varieties may produce less than the other plants. Growers often appreciate Outdoor Mix Regular’s ability to thrive in cooler climates, as all the strains are tough and resilient, even in cold weather. Lollipopping and supercropping are both effective training techniques for this mix. Effect, taste, and smell of Outdoor Mix RegularAll the plants grown from Outdoor Mix Regular are indica-dominant. This means that their high is typically indica in personality; a deep, relaxing body-stone that’s often long-lasting. The autoflowering varieties offer a less potent high, which some users claim makes them a solid option for daily use.The scent of the plants is also typical of indica. There’s a distinct note of skunk, combined with an overall aroma of earthiness, and a hint of sweetness and spice. The smell often becomes more noticeable as the plants reach harvest-time, and the flavours carry through to the taste too. Did you know? Outdoor Mix Regular is a random mix of five different varieties, and there’s no way of telling which seed will grow into which strain. This makes it a good choice for those who want to practice their identification skills.All five varieties have been developed to thrive, even in cooler temperatures. The strains have been carefully selected to complement one another.All the seeds in Outdoor Mix Regular can be grown together.The mix will last an entire outdoor season. Although the plants share certain traits (in appearance, scent and high), there are subtle differences between the strains.
