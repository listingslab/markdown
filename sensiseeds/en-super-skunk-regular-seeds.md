Super Skunk has been winning awards and fans since its release in 1990. Strong plants and strong effects are the result of crossing our world-famous Skunk #1 with a robust, high yielding Afghan indica. The deeply relaxing effects are enlivened by the sativa element, providing a long-lasting stone that’s strong without being soporific. Growth pattern of Super Skunk RegularSuper Skunk Regular cannabis seeds produce strong, uniform plants. Conical in shape, they grow thick, densely packed branches. Thanks to the strain’s dominant indica genetics, the plants seldom grow beyond average height, which makes them easy to manage for indoor growers. Short vegetation periods ensure that Super Skunk remains compact; yields can be increased by extending the vegetation length instead. This is a Regular strain, which means the seeds will produce both male and female plants. This advantage presents opportunities for creating cross-breeds. It’s also a smart choice for those seeking a robust strain that can withstand environmental fluctuations, and is ideal for new growers attempting their first outdoor crop. Super Skunk is a mix of 80% indica and 20% sativa. It has a short flowering time of around seven weeks. Once flowering commences, the buds develop quickly. Their appearance is pure indica: large, heavy, and coated in trichomes. Expect big yields from this plant! This strain is well suited to indoor cultivation under lights. However, it is possible to grow Super Skunk outdoors in temperate climates. In normal summer conditions, plants will produce excellent harvests of large buds. They’re also ideal for cultivating in greenhouses, though adequate airflow must be provided, particularly in the last couple of weeks of flowering. More experienced growers may like to experiment with techniques like fimming, topping, and lollipopping, as Super Skunk responds well to all of them. Topping and fimming are especially effective at boosting yields - the colas on the new ‘main’ branches will grow considerably larger. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk RegularSuper Skunk produces a noticeably intense scent; especially during the later stages of the flowering period. It’s not quite the same as other members of the skunk family, due to its sweet citrusy aroma, which combines pleasingly with the earthy, spicy base-notes. However, be aware that the smell is strong. Indoor growers may want to use air scrubbers to stop the scent spreading beyond the grow space. Upon consumption, people often notice that the scent is replicated in the taste; citrus-dominant, earthy, and with a hint of sweetness. Some have even compared the flavour to mandarin orange. The effects of Super Skunk are potent, and its relaxing qualities make it suitable for those looking for stress-relief. The balance of indica and sativa results in a high that’s uplifting and pleasant, while remaining calming and tranquil. Did you know?
