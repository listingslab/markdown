Durban Feminized is a chunky subtropical sativa grows abundantly across southern Africa and is enjoyed everywhere. It’s an adaptable plant that can be cultivated in any location that offers from 8 to 12 hours of sunlight a day during the normal growing season. We created Durban Feminized cannabis seeds to produce a perfect outdoor sativa for growers of all experience levels. It’s quick, mould-resistant, and a great yielder, even in a disappointing summer!Growth pattern of Durban FeminizedWeve bred Durban Feminized cannabis seeds to produce exceptionally pure outdoor sativa plants. Parent strain Durban Poison is one of the worlds most famous cannabis landraces, and we wanted to make it accessible to you. Developed using only specific plants from the established Durban gene pool, these seeds ensure the heritage of the strain remains intact. The plants are slightly shorter than other Durban strains. They also take less time to flower, and produce denser groups of flowers during the blooming stage. Expect to see a substantial main stem, flanked by strong lateral branches, develop during the vegetation period. Once flowering properly begins the calyxes grow at the nodes, then spread upwards, filling in the spaces on the branches and main stem. The short pistils are often pink or yellow to begin with, then darken as the plants continue to grow. Durban Feminized is a good option for beginners, as it can withstand most common grower errors. Its resilience and reliability mean it can produce plentiful yields, even in colder climates. The plants grow steadily. By keeping the vegetation period short and/or cutting them back, their height can be limited to just 150 centimetres if required. Using this approach makes it well-suited to growing in smaller gardens, or even on a balcony. Gardeners looking to maximise the height should start the seeds indoors in early spring, move them outside once the frosts are definitely over, then resist pruning or cutting them back. This approach results in plants that are around a metre taller. The height of Durban Feminized means it benefits from techniques like training or supercropping. If growing compact plants, the Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG) methods can be used instead. The thicker lateral branches mean that lollipopping isn’t usually beneficial. Effect, taste, and smell of Durban FeminizedDurban Feminized produces distinctively sweet aromas and flavours, with strong top notes of citrus and aniseed. Plants with darker leaves often have an earthier, warmer scent while they’re flowering, which subtly shifts to coffee, sandalwood or even chocolate. Celebrated for its powerful cerebral high, yet also calming and relaxing, Durban Feminized is ideal for creative activities. The effects are exceptionally smooth, but intense rather than mild.
