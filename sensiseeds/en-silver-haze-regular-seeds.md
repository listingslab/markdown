Silver Haze Regular seeds produce silvery, shiny buds with high levels of THC. Genetically, this tall-growing cannabis strain is based on 75% sativa genes. Accordingly, the uplifting effect is evident primarily in the mind. Silver Haze Regular Growth PatternThe original Haze strains were hugely popular in the 1970s. They were loved for their strong, almost psychedelic effect that was perfectly in tune with the upcoming hippie movement of the time. Although people of the flower power age loved the cracking rush, Haze was soon threatened with extinction. Too slow, yields that were too small, plants growing too high: such was the damning opinion of indoor growers who stirred up the scene in the 1980s. But then came Silver Haze. Sensi Seeds successfully created a seed line which combines the entire Haze experience in a more compact and faster form. Together with its big sister, Northern lights #5 X Haze, Silver Haze saved the psychedelic sativas from disappearing. The extreme height gain and long flowering stage were brought under control by crossing it with a Northern Lights. The dark indica also adds weight to the scales, which benefits the light and fragile structure of the original Haze. With 75% sativa genes, Silver Haze is of course still a tall-growing plant – expect it to grow to more than three times its original height during flowering. But this also means that seedlings and clones can very quickly be forced to flower in closed cultivation facilities. The best results can be achieved with a Screen of Green (SCROG). Silver Haze Regular also responds well to Supercropping and Lollipopping. Outdoor cultivation should be considered only in warm climates with long summers.The plants take around 65 to 75 days to flower. When the buds are covered with a sticky, silvery layer of trichome, it’s harvest time.Effect, Flavour and Smell of Silver Haze RegularAfter lighting up, it’s just a few moments before the Haze high sets in. Euphoric, creative and happy are words repeatedly heard in this context. Note that this is a strain that has a high THC content.Creative people have long valued Haze strains as a source of inspiration. Whether in the morning, during the day or in the evening – Silver Haze is suitable for any time of the day, although there are better alternatives just before bedtime.Depending on the phenotype, the smell and taste range from earthy, pine-like and sweet to woody with a hint of mint and citrus.Did you know?Silver Haze took first place at the High Times Cannabis Cup 1989. We’re even happier about the many positive customer votes we’ve received since then.For even easier growing, this cannabis strain is also available as Silver Haze Feminized.
