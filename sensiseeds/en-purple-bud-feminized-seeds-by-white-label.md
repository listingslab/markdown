We drew on the outstanding cannabis heritage of Jamaica and Afghanistan to create Purple Bud Feminized. It’s easy to cultivate indoors or out, even in cold climates with summers that end quickly. Low temperatures will actually encourage the plants to become more purple as flowering progresses, resulting in a colourful harvest of dense buds. The effect is a long-lasting sense of cheerful relaxation, perfect for social or solo consumption.Growth pattern of Purple Bud FeminizedWhite Label’s Purple Bud Feminized cannabis seeds have been developed from the Hindu Kush range, which includes some of the most prized indica strains in the world. The plants are typically indica in growth structure, with sturdy, short stems and branches. However, they’re a little taller than average indicas, which gives away their sativa component. Purple Bud Feminized can be kept compact by ensuring the vegetation stage is short; alternatively, the plants can be made taller by extending it. The strain is robust and able to withstand most minor cultivation issues. Even those with little experience should be able to generate good results from this strain; along with White Skunk, it is recognised as an excellent ‘beginner’s option’.Purple Bud Feminized has a short flowering time, with a blooming cycle of about nine weeks. During this time, a sizeable yield of purple flowers appears around the nodes, and up the stem and branches. The buds are dense, solid and spiky, and have a thick coating of trichomes. As with all ‘purple weed’ strains, the leaves and flowers may begin to turn violet if exposed to lower temperatures. However, as each plant is an individual, some of them will always remain green. This is due to naturally occurring variation, and is very much a characteristic of this type of cannabis. However, the Purple Bud family has been carefully bred to maximise purple coloration, and many of the plants will display shades of purple as the flowering stage comes to an end. Some may even have purple-hued leaves, while others will retain green leaves which contrast beautifully with the purple cannabis flowers. Purple Bud Feminized grows well indoors, and the Sea of Green (SOG) and Screen of Green (SCROG) methods are both good options during cultivation. The plants also respond well to topping, which creates multiple main stems and colas. It can be grown outside, in temperate and continental climates. When planted in early spring, in free soil, Purple Bud Feminized is capable of achieving considerable heights for a ‘compact’ plant, and is likely to produce an excellent harvest. Effect, taste, and smell of Purple Bud Feminized by White LabelPurple Bud Feminized has the classic earthy scent of an indica hybrid, combined with a herbal sweetness and hints of blueberry. This aroma intensifies as the plant enters the flowering period. Upon consumption, growers will notice that the sweet notes come through strongly, and are balanced with a hint of spice and pine. Some people favour vaping the buds to ensure that the flavours are fully released. Thanks to its indica / sativa parentage, Purple Bud Feminized produces an initial uplifting high. This then smoothly develops into a deeply relaxing feeling, which can last a couple of hours or longer. Some users claim that it’s a good ‘bedtime’ option, as it has a pleasantly soporific effect. However, larger quantities can have the opposite effect and make the mind more active.Did you know?
