Fly high with flowers from The Bird Feminized seeds. This high-yielding strain produces gorgeous harvests of bright green and purple flowers covered in a forest of white trichomes. The effects are immediate, undeniable, and highly enjoyable. The Bird Feminized seeds grow into plants with short flowering times and minimal maintenance needs. Growth pattern of The Bird FeminizedThe Bird Feminized is a 70% indica / 30% sativa plant created under the unique Breeding Grounds project. We used our own OG Kush and outcrossing it with a combination of Humboldt Dreams and Larry Bird from Humboldt Seed Company. The offspring are compact plants with short internodal spacing and sturdy branches. The Bird is offered as a feminized seed, which means no hassle in separating male and female plants.Flowering time for The Bird Feminized is typically 55 to 65 days. At harvest time, indoor growers with favourable conditions can see this plant reach a final height between 80-100 cm. If growing outside, a temperate / Continental or sunny / Mediterranean climate is recommended. In those regions, plants have reached a final height of 80-120 cm or greater.The Bird Feminized can offer large yields for growers with the right conditions. Flowers form into chunky, round, and dense buds that fill the nodes and apical tips of every branch. Yields of these sticky flowers can reach 500-550 grams per mÂ² indoors. Outdoor growers can look for yields topping 600 grams per plant with favourable weather conditions. Plant training techniques like SCROG, SOG, Supercropping, and Lollipopping can be used to increase yields.Effects, taste, and smell of The Bird FeminizedOne whiff of the potent terpene profile from The Bird Feminized is enough to alter your state of affairs. The onset of effects begins once it crosses the lips. A soothing wave of peacefulness washes over the body from head to toe, setting the tone for a long-lasting and relaxing experience. Find a comfy place to enjoy a movie, some music, or your favourite book and let the mellow mood and body bliss of The Bird Feminized melt your stress and tensions away.The Bird Feminized plant produces flowers with a robust profile fitting of the high-powered effects. Whether you prefer the taste or the smell of a flower the most, these two profiles from The Bird Feminized are in unison. Bitter, fuel-like, gassy aromas with hints of exotic sandalwood hit the nose and tastebuds before anything else. Contributing to the bite of the profile is an acrid skunk odour that adds a layer of lip-curling allure to The Bird Feminized. The final component of the full terpene and flavour profile would be what is best described as funky bad breath, yet it finds a way to be pleasurable. Did you know?The Bird has high THC levels!It was developed in collaboration with Humboldt Seed Company, as part of the Breeding Grounds project.
