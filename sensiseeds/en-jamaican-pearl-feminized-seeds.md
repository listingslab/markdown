Caribbean ganja tailored to the European climate. Jamaican Pearl Feminized cannabis seeds combine a sweet aroma with an energetic sativa high. Because these are feminized seeds, which produce only female plants, success is guaranteed. Ideally suited for outdoor cultivation.Jamaican Pearl has its origins in a Sensi Seeds breeding programme which focused on tropical sativas. We have crossbred dozens of cannabis strains to get a Jamaica weed that will grow in northern climates, and even finish flowering in a rainy Dutch summer. Jamaican Pearl is a hybrid between Marley’s Collie and Early Pearl with a sativa content of 85%.Jamaican Pearl Feminized growth patternPlants sown early reach a height of up to 3 m outside. Flowering normally lasts from August to the end of September. At latitudes around 50°, the plants enjoy an additional month in flower. The large, shaggy and fast-growing buds mean the Jamaican Pearl Feminized is one of our most reliable and most productive outdoor strains. These seeds of course also thrive under artificial light. Following a short vegetation phase, the plants flower for nine to 11 weeks. This cannabis strain grows more bushily than most indoor types. If the ceiling of the growing room isn’t high enough, we recommend a Screen of Green (SCROG), with the plants secured to a trellis net. This strain is also suitable for Supercropping and Lollipopping.The majority of marijuana strains are tropical sativas, but a small part of their gene pool is determined by indica strains which came to the Caribbean islands from the Indian subcontinent. The shorter and wider growth pattern of the Jamaican Pearl Feminized, and the exceptional bud structure, are examples of the indica influence. Effect, flavour and smell of Jamaican Pearl FeminizedLooking for a weed to bring a smile to your face and banish all your worries? Try our pearl of Jamaica! Compared to Haze strains, the mood-enhancing high is relatively mild, but also more manageable. The effect fits well with daily activities, or with an evening with friends enjoying some great food. This cannabis strain produces buds with an intense flavour comprising fruity and earthy tones. Put it to the test and break open a freshly dried bud. Your fingertips will be covered with a sticky layer of resin with the scent of a summer’s evening in the Caribbean.Did you know?Jamaican Pearl is one of our award-winning strains. It twice took the top prize at the prestigious Highlife Festival. This cannabis strain is also available as Jamaican Pearl Regular.
