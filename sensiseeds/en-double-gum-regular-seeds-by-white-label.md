Double Gum Regular by White Label is a surprisingly sweet 80/20 indica hybrid with a short flowering time and large central cola. The physical stone feel is accompanied by a pinch of euphoria.Double Gum Regular by White Label growth patternWith 80% indica and just 20% sativa genes, it’s simple to work with under all conditions.

Old-school growers still favour regular seeds because they produce better mother plants for cloning. Double Gum Regular by White Label has a comparatively short flowering time of around 50 days, with only small height gain. It is predestined for indoor cultivation. Good results can also be achieved in a greenhouse and outside (given a warm climate).Typically of this cannabis strain is a large central cola surrounded by small side branches.

A Sea of Green (SOG), for example, is particularly suitable for this strain.Effect, flavour and smell of Double Gum Regular by White LabelTypically of an indica, this weed delivers a classic body high that triggers a pleasant heaviness and a sense of deep satisfaction. Anyone looking for a relaxed chill-out on the couch after a tough day can’t go wrong with this strain.
