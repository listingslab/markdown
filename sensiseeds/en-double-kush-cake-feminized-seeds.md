Double Kush Cake Feminized is 65% indica and 35% sativa. The indica dominance is especially evident in the compact size of the plants, and the effect, which is deeply relaxing with a mild cerebral buzz. It was bred during the Sensi Seeds Research Project of 2021, and its parentage is impressive: Afghani# 1, Hindu Kush, and Skunk Kush. Double Kush Cake takes its name from its kush heritage, and its sweet, earthy flavour. It grows well in temperate and continental climates. Growth pattern of Double Kush Cake FeminizedDouble Kush Cake Feminized cannabis seeds are 65% indica, 35% sativa. They were developed in the 2021 Sensi Seeds Research Project, and have excellent genetics. The parent plants are Hindu Kush, Afghani #1, and Skunk Kush. Unsurprisingly, it’s the two Kush varieties that give this new strain its name. This is the feminized version, which offers the advantage of only producing plants that will grow and flower as females. That means there’s no need to identify and remove any non-female plants during cultivation. Double Kush Cake has an average flowering time of about eight weeks (indoors), so growers won’t need to wait too long to gather their harvest. The indica dominance means that the plants remain compact, regardless of whether they’re grown indoors or outside. This is ideal for those who want to cultivate the plants without them attracting a lot of attention. They’re classically indica in appearance too: bushy and squat, with plentiful side branches and a sturdy central cola. Growers particularly appreciate Double Kush Cake’s generous yields, and it’s possible to generate excellent harvests without too much effort. The buds are large and weighty, and covered in sticky resin. If growing the plants outside, make sure they’re in a temperate or continental climate, as this will ensure the best possible results. They also grow well inside, under lights. The strain is ideal for experimental growers who like trying out varied cultivation techniques, with the plants responding well to SOG (Sea of Green), SCROG (Screen of Green), lollipopping, and supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of Double Kush Cake FeminizedThe strain is indica-dominant, and this is not only clear in the appearance of the plants, but their resulting high too. Users can anticipate a deeply soothing stone, and a sense of full-body relaxation. There’s also a hint of sativa buzz, which provides a subtle uplift. The scent of Double Kush Cake Feminized is earthy, dank and hashy, with mouth-watering notes of sweetness. Be aware, this smell intensifies as the plants mature, and growers often recommend cultivating them in a well-ventilated area. The flavour is similarly sweet, earthy and intense. Did you know?
