White Ice Feminized by White Label offers a potent, calming stone, thanks to its 80% indica genetics. It’s a compact strain, which makes it a good choice for discreet growing; and it takes its name from the icy resin that forms on its buds. The scent is pleasantly sweet and tangy, with a hint of wood. Growers usually enjoy bumper yields, even when the plants’ heights are restricted.
