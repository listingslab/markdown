It is produced from EU-certified hemp plants, without pesticides, herbicides or additives that could harm humans or the environment.CBDCannabidiol, or CBD, is a natural constituent of the Cannabis sativa L. plant. It has no psychoactive effects. Coconut oilWith high levels of the relatively rare lauric acid, coconut oil has been hailed as a ‘superfood’. Lauric acid, which makes up half of the fatty acid content in coconut oil, is converted to monolaurin in the body – a molecule that has shown antibacterial, antiviral and antiprotozoal properties. Because of its potential immune-boosting properties, coconut oil has been identified as a useful food supplement for boosting the effects of cancer treatment.Hemp oilPressed from the seed of the hemp plant, hemp oil is rich in essential amino acids and fatty acids, including gamma-linolenic acids (GLA), and is the only plant source of vitamin D. It is the most unsaturated oil available and contains omega-3 and omega-6 in the ratio 1:3, which help make skin more elastic and hair shinier and stronger. Among many other nutrients, hemp oil also provides a dose of folic acid, iron and vitamin E antioxidants. It is reported to boost immunity, protect the skin from ageing and keep the heart healthy.Grown with careSensi Seeds takes care of its CBD Coconut Hemp Oil, from planting the first seed to packaging the last bottle. Only the flowers and leaves of the industrial hemp plants, which are harvested at the end of summer, are used to produce CBD, and cold pressed hemp seeds are used to produce the hemp oil. The hemp is grown in Europe with the greatest respect for nature and only the finest extra virgin coconut oil is added.A natural nutrient boostImagine waking up every day feeling more rested, healthier and happier.
