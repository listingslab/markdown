A classic, pure indica characterised by its robust nature, compact growth and short flowering time (45 to 50 days). Also suitable for novices. This original, pure indica comes from the Hindu Kush, a remote mountainous region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This classic variety owes a number of attributes that are beneficial to growers to its origins in the mountains. The thick coat of trichomes protect the plant against wind and poor weather. The white, glistening trichomes produce perfect hashish. They can also be enjoyed pure as kief. Plants grown from feminized Hindu Kush seeds are resistant to disease and mould. Novices love the great resilience in suboptimal growing conditions or fluctuating temperatures. Hindu Kush Feminized growth patternHindu Kush Feminized cannabis seeds produce plants with compact growth, a short flowering time (45 to 50 days) and medium yields. In the right hands, or given a longer growth phase, yields could be even higher. Grown in a moderate climate and given a long summer, the plants reach impressive heights. These cannabis strains produce short, strong branches with heavy buds that rapidly grow bigger in the flowering phase. These plants hold a lot of their energy in the central cola. This growth pattern makes them perfect for cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG) or Lollipopping. Effect, flavour and smell of Hindu Kush FeminizedHindu Kush Feminized brings a sense of deep peace, which is incredibly relaxing. Only few users report the often unwanted couch lock effect typical of indicas.Expect a distinctive aroma. It is a combination of aromatic woods and classic Afghan base notes. Many other hybrids are based on Hindu Kush, but the characteristic sandalwood flavour remains unique. There is a sweet note at the start of the flowering time, which, after the buds mature, is transformed into a savoury flavour that is immediately recognisable to aficionados. Did you know?Hindu Kush Feminized is an absolute classic among cannabis strains. Did you know that Katie Melua even dedicated one of her songs to this strain? “Halfway Up The Hindu Kush” is the perfect musical accompaniment to a relaxed evening on the sofa. According to “High Times” magazine, Hindu Kush from Sensi Seeds is one of the best 25 cannabis strains of all time.In addition to these feminized seeds, Hindu Kush is also available as Hindu Kush Regular and Hindu Kush Automatic.
