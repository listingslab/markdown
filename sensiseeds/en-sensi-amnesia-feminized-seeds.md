Sensi Amnesia Feminized is 65% sativa and 35% indica. Like the automatic variant, which was released in 2020, this strain is sativa-like in appearance, and offers large yields. The high is typically sativa too; cerebral, chatty and uplifting, with a scent that’s earthy and with notes of citrus. Growers can anticipate a longer-than-usual flowering period, and taller-than-average plants. Growth pattern of Sensi Amnesia FeminizedSensi Amnesia Feminized cannabis seeds are 65% sativa and 35% indica. The automatic version of the strain was originally developed by Sensi Seeds as part of their 2020 Research Project, and now we’ve introduced this variant, which is feminized.The strain boasts an impressive gene pool, with its parent-plants being Jamaican Pearl, Hawaiian Indica, and Afghani #1. As this is the feminized version, the seeds will not produce any male plants, which makes cultivation easier. Although the flowering period is fairly long for Sensi Amnesia Feminized (around 10 weeks), most growers agree that it’s worth the wait. The plants grow fairly tall, and can reach well over two metres in height when cultivated outside in free soil. This is something to bear in mind if trying to grow them discreetly. The plants have the stretched-out appearance of a sativa, with the sturdiness and ‘Christmas tree’ shape more commonly associated with indica varieties. They produce excellent yields, both indoors and outside. The buds are fairly compact and very resinous, and usually grow along the central stem and towards the tips of the lateral branches. Often, their growth is so expansive that individual buds will join up along the top half of the stem, forming large colas. To get the best possible results from Sensi Amnesia Feminized, it’s recommended that the plants are grown in either a temperate or continental climate. Alternatively, they can be cultivated inside under artificial lights, but note that they’ll need plenty of room to flourish. More experienced growers will be pleased to know that the strain responds well to cultivation techniques, like SOG (Sea of Green), SCROG (Screen of Green), and supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of Sensi Amnesia FeminizedThis strain is sativa-dominant, and that’s very obvious in the resulting high. Upon consumption, users note an immediate uplift, followed by a sense of chattiness and sociability. It’s an energetic, creative high, and is well-suited to an evening with friends. The sativa influence also comes through in the aroma of the plants, with a scent that’s tropical, citrussy and spicy, softened by a hint of indica dankness and earthiness in the base notes. Expect the smell to grow stronger as the plants reach full maturity – and if growing indoors, make sure the area is well ventilated. Upon consuming the buds, users notice that many of the flavours are still in place, particularly the lemon and spice. Did you know?
