American Dream Regular combines tried and tested Afghani genetics with Jamaican and Hawaiian influences. This result is a gourmet strain that is suitable for discerning and commercial growers alike. The ‘American dream’ is a term first coined by the historian James Truslow Adams. He dreamed of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone. Sensi Seeds has developed this cannabis strain in analogy with the American dream. By selecting from a broad gene pool that has been improved over the decades, our experts have realised the dream of permanent progress.American Dream Regular growth patternThis indica hybrid (75% indica, 25% sativa) is based on an Afghan skunk strain and tropical sativas from Jamaica and Hawaii. In terms of strength, yield and stability, American Dream Regular impresses the most discerning growers. The compact plants grow evenly, with above-average height gain. Please note that these are regular cannabis seeds which produce male and female plants.In the right hands, American Dream Regular produces a plentiful yield. It is characterised by fist-sized buds bursting with pistils and covered by a sticky layer of resin. The structure is typically indica: at the beginning of the flowering stage (7 to 8 weeks), the sativa influence is also apparent in the light-green leaves.These plants perform best indoors under artificial light. Outdoor cultivation will also succeed provided that summers are warm. At best, up to 1 kg can be harvested from a single plant. Advanced cultivation methods such as SOG (Sea of Green) or SCROG (Screen of Green) promise particularly good results.Effect, flavour and smell of American Dream RegularThe first sign of the effect of this cannabis strain is a pleasant lightness that slowly spreads throughout the entire body. Many smokers become happier and more sociable. In comparison with other indica-dominant strains, American Dream Regular does not trigger couch lock. As a result, it is suitable for use during the day as well as in the evenings. The pungent skunk smell is accompanied by a distinctive pine tone. The flavour is rounded off with fresh, fruity notes.Did you know?American Dream smells comparatively strong. Stealth growers who value discretion should select a different strain. An alternative is the award-winning Northern Lights Regular.
