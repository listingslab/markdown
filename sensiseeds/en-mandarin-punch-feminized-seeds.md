Mandarin Punch Feminized cannabis seeds are 60% indica and 40% sativa. The parentage of this new strain is Maple Leaf Indica, White Widow, NYC Diesel and California Indica. It’s part of the Sensi Seeds Research Project for 2021, and gives growers the opportunity to enjoy big yields when grown in temperate or continental climates. As the name suggests, the plants produce a pleasantly sweet orange citrus aroma when growing, which carries through to the flavour. Growth pattern of Mandarin Punch FeminizedMandarin Punch Feminized is a fairly even balance of indica (60%) and sativa (40%) – something that is evident in the average height of the plants, and the resulting high, which is relaxing, yet uplifting. This strain was produced as part of Sensi Seeds’ 2021 Research Project, and as such, has impressive genetics. The aim of Sensi Seeds Research is to combine the best new strains with our award-winning favourites. This is the feminized version of the strain, so there are no male plants to contend with. That makes cultivation easier, as there’s no requirement to identify or remove them before they start properly flowering. Mandarin Punch has an average flowering time of between 7 and 10 weeks. The plants only reach average height, which makes them ideal for growing both indoors and outside. In appearance, they clearly display their indica dominance, with a sturdy central stem, and lots of leafy branches. The yield is one of this strain’s biggest selling points. Growers can anticipate a plentiful harvest, regardless of whether the plants are being cultivated inside or out in the garden. The buds are also worthy of mention: they’re big, dense, and tend to gather around the central cola, rather than on the branches. To generate the best possible results, it’s recommended that Mandarin Punch Feminized is grown in a continental or temperate climate. The plants respond well to certain cultivation techniques, including SCROG (Screen of Green), SOG (Sea of Green), lollipopping and supercropping.
