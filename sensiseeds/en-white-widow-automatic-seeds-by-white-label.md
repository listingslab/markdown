White Widow has been holding its own against its younger competitors for 20 years. White Widow Automatic seeds by White Label combine the strengths of the original with the simplicity of an autoflowering strain – a great choice not just for novices! White Widow Automatic by White Label growth patternThere are now many commercial providers of autoflowering cannabis, but only a few strains deliver what they promise. White Widow Auto by White Label is justifiably one of the most popular autoflowering varieties. Just like the original, it comprises 65% indica and 35% sativa genes. The cross with Ruderalis plants yielded a strong hybrid.There are many advantages to autoflowering strains. Because the plants start to flower automatically after a while, growers don’t need to grapple with lighting cycles and light spectrums. Autoflowering cannabis is undemanding, and is forgiving of growing mistakes as well as temperature fluctuations. Because this is a strain of feminized seeds, which produce female plants only, there’s no need to weed out male shoots. Flowering begins just three to four weeks after germination. The entire life cycle through to harvest takes around 75 days. This allows two summer harvests to be achieved on the same patch. With indoor cultivation, as many as three to four harvests are achievable per year. Compared with normal strains, autoflowering plants are nicely compact, but have a slightly lower yield as a result. A Sea of Green (SOG) can combat this. Effect, flavour and smell of White Widow Automatic by White LabelWhite Widow Automatic by White Label delivers a chilled high. The dried buds have a more distinct body stone effect than the normal and feminized version. But because the overall effect is a little weaker, White Widow Automatic by White Label can be used during the day as well as in the evening.In terms of flavour and aroma, this weed is easily recognisable as a member of the White Widow family. Which means: sweet, sharp, bitter and earthy tones combine to create a delicious overall experience. Pine flavours are perceptible with almost all phenotypes; some also have a fresh citrus flavour.Did you know?White Widow Regular by White Label and White Widow Feminized by White Label are also available. All varieties of this cannabis strain are resilient and easy to grow.
