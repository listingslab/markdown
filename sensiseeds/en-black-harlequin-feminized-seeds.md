Black Harlequin Feminized is an indica / sativa hybrid. Its formidable genetic pool includes our own Black Domina, a Cannabis Cup-winner; and Harlequin, a strong CBD strain from the USA. Growers can anticipate huge yields from their plants, and a scent that’s floral, woody and earthy. They have a THC / CBD ratio of 1:1, and offer consumers a high that’s wonderfully relaxing for the body and mind, with plenty of balance. This special strain began life as one of our 2019 Sensi Seeds Research varieties.
