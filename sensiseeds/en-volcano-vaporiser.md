The Volcano System Inhaler releases flavouring and active ingredients from herbs through vaporisation by hot air. Optimum treatment of the active ingredients reduces the development of harmful substances and odours to a minimum. This means that even non-smokers find the inhaler extremely enjoyable.A further advantage of the Volcano is the exploitation of active ingredients, being 3-4 times greater when compared with smoking, an aspect which makes investment in the device pay for itself in the shortest possible time.
