Ruderalis Indica Regular is a 90% indica that thrives even in cold climates. With a relatively high amount of CBD and little THC, it’s of interest in particular to consumers wanting to enjoy the effect of the cannabinoids without being overwhelmed by a strong high. Ruderalis Indica Regular growth pattern Ruderalis Indica embodies the unique properties of Cannabis Ruderalis, which grows in Eastern Europe. By crossing it with classical indica strains, the Sensi Seeds breeders have given it some added pep. The result is a fast-growing, compact and practical hardy beauty that flourishes magnificently anywhere.What many people do not know: Ruderalis Indica Regular seeds are semi-autoflowering, which means that half of the plants begin to flower independently with no adjustment to the lighting period. Even today, behind every autoflowering strain is a Ruderalis plant. Ruderalis Indica has a short flowering time (40 to 50 days), with adult plants growing from seedlings within 10 to 12 weeks. Cold or rainy summers can’t touch this fighter. It is suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.Advanced cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Supercropping and Lollipopping are unnecessary with this strain. Yields are moderate.Effect, flavour and smell of Ruderalis Indica RegularRuderalis Indica Regular is not the right strain for powerful intoxication. With little THC and a relatively high amount of CBD, it is a functional cannabis strain that can be enjoyed at any time of the day. The cannabinoid profile makes Ruderalis Indica Regular an interesting medicinal strain. Don’t expect any great highs with respect to taste and smell. The dried buds of Ruderalis Indica Regular generally smell and taste rather neutral. Some buds contain relatively high amounts of myrcene and caryophyllales, which can result in a flowery flavour. Did you know?The main difference between Cannabis ruderalis and Cannabis sativa as well as Cannabis indica is that Ruderalis plants begin to flower automatically. It’s still not certain whether ruderalis is a type in itself, or simply a variety of sativa.
