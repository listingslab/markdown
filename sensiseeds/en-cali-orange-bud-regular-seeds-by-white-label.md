A legendary indica hybrid from sunny California. The orange pistils sit perfectly with the light-green calyxes. Relaxing and creative vibes guaranteed!Cali Orange Bud Regular by White Label growth pattern Cali Orange Bud reached the rainy Netherlands from the American west coast at the start of the 1980s, and was then adapted for indoor growing and for greenhouses. Cali Orange Bud Regular cannabis seeds by White Label produce both male and female plants with a growth pattern typical of an indica. They remain nicely compact (generally under 1 m) and are ready to harvest after just 45 to 55 days in flower. With the love, care and nurturing they need, these plants will deliver a lush yield. 350 g/m² is perfectly possible. A Sea of Green (SOG), with lots of small plants next to each other rather than a few large plants, yields the best results. To ensure the plants grow as homogeneously as possible, it is best to use clones from the same mother plant. Cali Orange Bud Regular is less challenging than the original strain. But it’s still a ‘Californian Girl’ at heart and likes things warm and sunny. Anyone fortunate enough to live in a Mediterranean climate can also grow this strain outside in the open air. It can then grow to up to 2 m tall.Visually, this cannabis strain is a real eye-catcher. Calyxes drenched in crystals, orange pistils and light-green shading are all pleasing to the eye. Effect, flavour and smell of Cali Orange Bud Regular by White LabelCali Orange Bud Regular by White Label creates instant good humour. It exudes the typical Californian love of life – perfect for a rainy day in northern Europe! As a hybrid with 70% indica and 30% sativa, this cannabis strain combines a pleasant body buzz with an uplifting cerebral high. The perfect soundtrack to it? The melodious soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino’s latest film ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’ of course!Cali Orange Bud Regular by White Label tastes as good as it looks. The sweetish and at the same time spicy orange flavour pampers the palate. Interesting fact for guerrilla growers: there is hardly any smell to the plants during the vegetation phase.Did you know?The original Orange Bud is popular with American artists and musicians. It’s probably no coincidence that there are several songs with ‘Orange Bud’ in the title.
