As one of the darkest indicas ever, Black Domina Feminized is attracting aficionados in increasing numbers. This is a strongly sedative, almost pure indica with compact growth and a short flowering time.Sensi Seeds used four premium quality indica strains to create Black Domina. The result is an almost pure indica strain that packs more of a punch than the sum of its parts. We started with Northern Lights, one of our best-known strains thanks to its resin production. Then we added Ortega, which concentrates on the analgesic and soporific properties. The short flowering time and rich harvests come from the hash plant. Finally, we added an Afghanica known as “SA” to the mix. This gives Black Domina its strong growth and stable flower clusters.Black Domina Feminized growth patternThis four-way hybrid strain produces vigorous female plants with a degree of phenotype variation. In any case, growers can expect small height gain, intensive resin production, short flowering time (around 50 days) and fat buds. The dark green colouring is truly exceptional; in certain light conditions, the plants appear almost black. This pigmentation extends to the buds as well. Deep purple stripes are overlaid with orange hairs and a lush layer of trichomes. Black Domina Feminized cannabis seeds produce compact plants with a tendency to develop a solid central cola. Optimally suited for indoor cultivation, Black Domina Feminized can also be grown outdoors in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Either way, a Sea of Green (SOG) will yield the biggest harvests. Effect, flavour and smell of Black Domina FeminizedConsumers love this cannabis strain for its effect. It can be as strong as a narcotic. Before heading off to dreamland, every fibre of the body seems to relax. This weed is not recommended for daytime consumption, with one exception of course: “Netflix and chill”.The savoury flavours of Black Domina Feminized combine subtle tones of blackberry and pepper with a black hashish finish. Both the smell and taste contain this distinctive blend of aromas. They overlay an earthy Afghani undertone that experienced consumers will recognise immediately. Did you know?For purists, this cannabis strain is also available as Black Domina Regular.
