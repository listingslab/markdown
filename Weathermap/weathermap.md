Wethermap is an old fashioned Mashup, like we did in the mid 2000's

In the context of web apps, mashups refer to the practice of combining data or functionalities from two or more different sources to create a new, integrated application or service. The term "mashup" originated from the music industry, where it referred to a blend of two or more songs to create a new composition.

In the context of web applications, mashups involve integrating data or services from various sources, typically using public APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), to create a more useful and powerful application. These mashups allow developers to leverage existing services and data without having to build everything from scratch.

For example, a real estate website might create a mashup by integrating Google Maps API to display property locations on a map, Zillow API to retrieve property details, and Yelp API to show nearby amenities like restaurants and schools. This integration of various services enhances the user experience and provides a comprehensive solution.

Mashups gained popularity in the mid-2000s, when there was a surge in the availability of public APIs from various companies and services. It allowed developers to combine functionality from different platforms, leading to innovative and dynamic web applications. Over time, the concept of mashups has evolved, and newer technologies and practices have emerged, such as microservices and serverless architectures, but the core idea of combining services for added value remains relevant in modern web development.
