Aquaponics is a sustainable system of food production that combines aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (soilless plant cultivation). It is a closed-loop system where fish and plants are grown together in a symbiotic relationship

Aquaponics offers several benefits. It conserves water compared to traditional farming methods, as water is continuously recycled. The system also requires less space since plants are grown vertically or in compact areas. Additionally, aquaponics eliminates the need for synthetic fertilizers, as the fish waste provides the necessary nutrients for plant growth. The fish produced in the system can also be harvested for food, adding an additional source of income or sustenance

Aquaponics is practiced in various scales, from small-scale home systems to large commercial operations. It is an innovative and sustainable approach to agriculture that combines the benefits of aquaculture and hydroponics, offering a closed-loop system that maximizes resource utilization
