## What do Spies measure?

- ### Temperature  
	- Temperature now and historically as indicated on a scale of optimum
	- Historically past week (can we easily see a 12/12 flowering cycle?)
- ### Humidity  
	- Percentage now as indicated on a scale of Percentage of Relative Humidity 
- ### Light  
	- On or Off?
	- Hours of light in the past 24, 12, hour
	- Historically past week (can we easily see a 12/12 flowering cycle?)
- ### Moisture  
	- Soil sensors (if used)
		- TEST: Water them and look. Should be 100%. Wait several days and make sure the value drops. 
	- Use the _TimeEnlarger_ to see how quickly that happens. Then you know
- ### Air Pressure  
	- Perhaps not particularly useful to us. Unless it is. Anyway, itâ€™s there
