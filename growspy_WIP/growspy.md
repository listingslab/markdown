# [treachery](/packages/growspy/treachery)

###  Growspy's Story so far
As growers what we need is the ability to monitor Temperature, Humidity, Light & Soil Moisture data from a device connected to a Cloud API and view it using a phone. The data should go back as long as a week and be graphs

1. ### Software

> The Web App connects to the API and subscribes to real time updates to Spy data. Every time a Spy tings, it automagically updates

- Growspy.app
- [RESTful API](/techstack/api)
- [GitHub](/open-source/github)

2. ### Device

> Monitors Temperature, Humidity, Light & Soil Moisture and sends readings to Growspy API every 5 minutes. Readings are monitored on any mobile phone

> When the Enviro Grow is awake it can also connect to the internet via your household wi-fi and post the readings data it has collected to the API in the cloud. This takes up a lot of power, but it's kinda critical, so we'll do it every 5 mins aswell

#### Partnerships

> It is [a truth universally acknowledged](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5882-it-is-a-truth-universally-acknowledged-that-a-single-man) that Software in posession of a good product, must be in want of a good business [partner](/contact)
